## Summary

2 Thessalonians 3 is the final chapter of Paul's second letter to the church in Thessalonica. The chapter is focused on prayer, discipline, and the importance of hard work. 

In the first verse of the chapter, Paul requests the Thessalonians to pray for the spread of the gospel. He asks for the Lord's word to be honored and spread rapidly, just as it was with them. This request for prayer sets the tone for the rest of the chapter, emphasizing the importance of prayer and the spreading of the gospel message.

The chapter is structured in four sections, each with a different focus. The first section, from verse 1-2, emphasizes the importance of prayer for the ministry of the gospel. The second section, from verse 3-5, expresses Paul's confidence in the Lord's protection and his trust in the Thessalonians to follow his instructions. 

The third section, from verse 6-15, deals with the issue of church discipline. Paul instructs the Thessalonians to distance themselves from those who refuse to work and instead choose to live in idleness. He emphasizes the need for hard work and the importance of setting a good example. Paul also encourages the Thessalonians not to lose heart in doing good, reminding them of the eternal reward that awaits them.

The final section, from verse 16-18, is a brief conclusion to the letter. Paul sends his final greetings and a benediction, praying that the Lord's grace would be with them all.

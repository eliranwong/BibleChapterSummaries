## Summary

Ezra chapter 6 begins with King Darius issuing an order to search the archives stored in the treasury in Babylon. The chapter is divided into five subheadings: Discovery of Cyrus' decree, Darius' response and provisions, Restarting and completing construction, Dedication of the temple, and Celebrating Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread.

Discovery of Cyrus' decree:
The archives stored in the treasury contain the decree of Cyrus, which allowed the Jews to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. The decree was discovered, and it was found that Cyrus had commanded the construction of the temple. This discovery was significant as it confirmed the authority of the Jews to rebuild the temple.

Darius' response and provisions:
King Darius responded to the discovery of Cyrus' decree by commanding that the construction of the temple should continue. He also provided resources and financial support for the construction. Darius emphasized that the temple should be completed with haste and that the Jews should be supported in their efforts.

Restarting and completing construction:
The Jews restarted construction of the temple, and it was completed according to the specifications laid out in the decree of Cyrus. The temple was finished in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius, on the third day of the month of Adar.

Dedication of the temple:
Once the temple was completed, it was dedicated with great celebration. The Levites and priests were consecrated for service in the temple, and sacrifices were offered to God. The dedication was marked with great joy and rejoicing, and the people praised God for his goodness.

Celebrating Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread:
After the dedication of the temple, the Jews celebrated the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. They observed these festivals with great enthusiasm and dedication, as they had not been able to celebrate them properly for many years.

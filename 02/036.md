## Summary

Exodus 36 is a continuation of the instructions given to Moses regarding the construction of the Tabernacle. In this chapter, the focus is on the work of the craftsmen and the contributions of the Israelites towards the construction of the Tabernacle.

The verses in this chapter are structured around two main themes: the work of the craftsmen and the contributions of the Israelites. The chapter begins with a description of the craftsmen who were chosen to do the work of constructing the Tabernacle. They are described as being skilled, knowledgeable, and able to work with a variety of materials. The craftsmen are then given instructions on the specific tasks they are to perform, including weaving, embroidery, and metalwork.

The second theme of the chapter is the contributions of the Israelites towards the construction of the Tabernacle. The people are described as being willing and generous in their giving, and they bring a variety of materials such as gold, silver, and precious stones. The chapter lists the specific items that were contributed, including fine linen, goat hair, and acacia wood.

One of the key verses in this chapter is Exodus 36:5 which states, "And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the Lord commanded to make." This verse highlights the generosity of the Israelites and their willingness to contribute to the construction of the Tabernacle.

There are several significant characters in this chapter, including Bezalel and Oholiab, who were chosen by God to lead the craftsmen in the construction of the Tabernacle. The chapter also mentions the contributions of the Israelites, who are portrayed as being faithful and obedient to God's commands.

The main theme of this chapter is the construction of the Tabernacle and the contributions of the Israelites towards this project. The chapter emphasizes the importance of skilled craftsmanship and the willingness of the people to give to God's work.

To understand the context of this chapter, it is important to know that the Tabernacle was a portable temple that was used by the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings. The Tabernacle was a symbol of God's presence among the people, and it was a place where they could worship and offer sacrifices to God.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter as a demonstration of the importance of skilled labor and the value of generosity. They also see it as a reminder of the importance of obedience to God's commands and the need to trust in His provision.

There are no significant controversies related to this chapter, but it is worth noting that the construction of the Tabernacle has been interpreted by some as a foreshadowing of the coming of Christ. The Tabernacle was seen as a temporary dwelling place for God among His people, while Christ is seen as the permanent dwelling place of God among His people.

Exodus 36 relates to other chapters in the Bible, specifically those that deal with the construction of the Tabernacle, such as Exodus 25-31 and Exodus 35-40. It also relates to the theme of God's presence among His people, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible.

The main lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of skilled labor and the value of generosity. The chapter also emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's commands and the need to trust in His provision. Overall, Exodus 36 is a chapter that highlights the faithfulness of the Israelites and their willingness to contribute to God's work.

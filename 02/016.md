# Exodus 16

## Subheadings

* From verse 1 - Manna and quail provided by God

## Summary

Exodus 16 details the provision of manna and quail from God to the Israelites in the wilderness. The chapter begins with the Israelites journeying from Elim to the wilderness of Sin, which is situated between Elim and Sinai. On the fifteenth day of the second month after leaving Egypt, the Israelites begin to complain to Moses and Aaron about their lack of food. They accuse them of bringing them out into the wilderness to starve to death.

In response, God tells Moses that He will rain down bread from heaven for the Israelites to eat, and they will gather enough for each day. On the sixth day, they will gather twice as much to prepare for the Sabbath when no manna will fall. Moses relays this message to the people, and the following morning, they wake up to find a layer of dew covering the ground. When the dew evaporates, it leaves behind a flaky substance that the Israelites do not recognize. Moses tells them that it is the bread that God promised them and instructs them to gather as much as they need for the day.

The Israelites obey, and they find that they have enough for everyone to eat. However, some of them try to gather more than they need, and the excess becomes rotten and filled with worms. On the sixth day, they gather twice as much, and it does not spoil. Moses tells them to keep some of it for the next day, and they find that it remains fresh.

In addition to the manna, God sends quail to the Israelites in the evening, and they eat it with the bread. The Israelites continue to receive manna and quail each day for forty years until they reach the border of Canaan.

The verses in this chapter are structured chronologically, starting with the Israelites' arrival in the wilderness of Sin and ending with the provision of manna and quail over forty years. The narrative follows a cause-and-effect pattern, where the Israelites' complaints about their hunger lead to God's provision of manna and quail.

The key verses in this chapter are Exodus 16:4-5, where God promises to provide bread from heaven for the Israelites to eat, and Exodus 16:15, where the Israelites ask Moses what the manna is and he tells them that it is the bread that God has given them to eat.

The significant characters in this chapter are Moses, Aaron, and the Israelites. The manna and quail are also symbolic of God's provision and care for His people.

The main themes of this chapter are God's provision for His people, the Israelites' lack of faith and trust in God, and the importance of obeying God's commands.

The historical and cultural context of this chapter is the Israelites' journey from Egypt to Canaan, which is a central event in Jewish history.

Theologians and scholars interpret this chapter as a demonstration of God's faithfulness and provision for His people, as well as a warning against disobedience and unbelief. Some also see parallels between the manna and Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the "bread of life" in the New Testament (John 6:35).

One controversy related to this chapter is the identity of the manna. Some scholars suggest that it was a type of resin produced by a desert shrub, while others believe that it was a miraculous substance created by God.

Exodus 16 relates to other chapters in the Bible, such as Numbers 11, where the Israelites complain about the manna and ask for meat, and John 6, where Jesus feeds the five thousand with bread and fish.

The lessons that can be taken from this chapter include trusting in God's provision, obeying His commands, and being content with what He has given us. It also serves as a reminder that complaining and unbelief can lead to consequences.

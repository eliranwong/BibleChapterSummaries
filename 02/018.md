* From verse 1 - Jethro's advice to Moses

## Summary

Exodus 18 is an important chapter in the book of Exodus that narrates the encounter between Moses and his father-in-law, Jethro. The chapter begins with Jethro, the priest of Midian, hearing about all the incredible things that God had done for Moses and the Israelites, including their miraculous escape from Egypt. Jethro then decides to visit Moses in the wilderness where he and the Israelites are encamped.

Jethro's advice to Moses is the focus of this chapter. Moses had been leading the Israelites alone, hearing their legal cases and disputes, and Jethro was concerned about the burden that this was placing on him. Seeing this, Jethro advises Moses to select able men from among the people to serve as judges and to share the work of judging the people with him. Jethro suggests that the judges be appointed to handle the smaller cases and only the more difficult cases should be brought to Moses.

The verses in this chapter are structured around Jethro’s advice to Moses. Verses 1-12 provide the context of Jethro’s visit and his conversation with Moses. Verses 13-23 contain Jethro’s advice to Moses, and verses 24-27 describe how Moses followed Jethro’s advice and appointed judges to help him with the work of judging the people.

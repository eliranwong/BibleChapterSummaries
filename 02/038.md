## Summary

Exodus 38 is primarily a continuation of the previous chapter, where instructions are given regarding the construction of the Tabernacle. This chapter describes the making of the altar of burnt offering, the bronze basin, and the courtyard of the Tabernacle.

The chapter begins with the construction of the altar of burnt offering, which was made of acacia wood and overlaid with bronze. The altar was square in shape, measuring five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high. The horns of the altar were also overlaid with bronze and used for the offering of sacrifices.

Next, the bronze basin is described, which was used by the priests for washing their hands and feet before entering the Tabernacle. The basin was made from bronze mirrors donated by the women who served at the entrance of the Tabernacle.

The chapter ends with a description of the courtyard of the Tabernacle, which was surrounded by a linen curtain that was one hundred cubits long and five cubits high. The curtain was supported by twenty pillars, topped with silver hooks and bands, and set in bronze bases.

The verses in this chapter are structured around the construction of the various items related to the Tabernacle. The chapter is divided into three sections: the altar of burnt offering, the bronze basin, and the courtyard of the Tabernacle.

One key verse in this chapter is Exodus 38:8, which states, "He made the bronze basin and its stand from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting."

The significant characters in this chapter are the craftsmen who constructed the items for the Tabernacle under the direction of Bezalel and Oholiab, as well as the women who donated their bronze mirrors for the construction of the basin.

The main themes of this chapter are obedience to God's instructions and the importance of worship and ritual cleanliness. The chapter emphasizes the importance of following God's instructions precisely in the construction of the Tabernacle and its related items. Additionally, the construction of the bronze basin highlights the importance of cleanliness and purity in approaching God.

The historical and cultural context of this chapter is important to understand the significance of the Tabernacle and its role in Jewish worship. The Tabernacle was a portable temple used by the Israelites during their time in the wilderness, and it served as a physical representation of God's presence among His people. The construction of the Tabernacle and its related items was a significant event in Jewish history, as it marked the establishment of a central place of worship for the Israelites.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter as a demonstration of the Israelites' obedience to God's instructions and their commitment to worship and purity. The construction of the Tabernacle and its related items was seen as a way for the Israelites to connect with God and show their reverence for Him.

There are no significant controversies related to this chapter, but there may be differing interpretations of the symbolism and significance of the various items described in the chapter.

This chapter relates to other chapters in the Bible, particularly those that describe the construction and use of the Tabernacle, such as Exodus 25-31 and 35-40.

The lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of obedience to God's instructions and the significance of worship and purity in approaching God. The construction of the Tabernacle and its related items serves as a reminder of the Israelites' commitment to God and their desire to be in His presence.

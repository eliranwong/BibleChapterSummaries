## Subheadings

* From verse 1 - Consecration of priests

## Summary

Exodus 29 is a chapter that provides detailed instructions on how to consecrate the priests who will serve in the tabernacle. The chapter is divided into two main sections: the consecration of the priests and the offerings for consecration.

Consecration of Priests:
The chapter begins with God commanding Moses to consecrate Aaron and his sons as priests. The consecration process involves taking a bull, two unblemished rams, unleavened bread, cakes made with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil. The priests-to-be are to be washed with water and then clothed in special garments. The bull is to be offered as a sin offering, and its blood is to be sprinkled on the altar and around it. One of the rams is to be offered as a burnt offering, and the other is to be offered as a consecration offering. The blood of the consecration offering is to be put on the right earlobes, right thumbs, and right big toes of Aaron and his sons. The rest of the blood is to be sprinkled on the altar and around it. The fat of the ram is to be placed on the breast and the right thigh of Aaron and his sons, and the breast and the thigh are to be waved before the Lord. The cakes and the unleavened wafers are also to be waved before the Lord, and then burned on the altar along with the fat.

Offerings for Consecration:
The second part of the chapter describes additional offerings that are to be made for the consecration of the priests. These offerings include a bull and a ram for a sin offering, a ram for a burnt offering, and a basket of unleavened bread. The sin offerings are to be made for seven consecutive days, with the same procedures as previously described. The burnt offering is also to be made every day for seven days, and the priests are to remain in the tabernacle during this time to complete their consecration.

Key Verses:
One of the key verses in this chapter is Exodus 29:44, where God says, "And I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar. I will also consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests." This verse emphasizes the importance of the consecration process and highlights the fact that the priests are not serving themselves, but are serving God.

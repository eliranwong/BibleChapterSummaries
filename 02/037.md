## Summary

Exodus 37 is a continuation of the previous chapter, where the Lord commanded Moses to build the Tabernacle and its furnishings. This chapter describes the completion of the Tabernacle and its furnishings by Bezalel and Oholiab, who were filled with the Spirit of God and given the skill and knowledge to carry out the work.

Verses 1-9 describe the making of the Ark of the Covenant, which was a sacred container for the tablets of the Law that God gave to Moses on Mount Sinai. The Ark was made of acacia wood and covered with gold both inside and out. It had four gold rings attached to its corners for carrying it, and a gold cover called the mercy seat on top, with two cherubim of gold on either end. This was the place where God's presence dwelt among the Israelites.

Verses 10-16 describe the making of the table for the bread of the Presence, which was also made of acacia wood and covered with gold. It had a border of gold around it and four gold rings for carrying it. The table had dishes, pans, and pitchers for the bread and drink offerings.

Verses 17-24 describe the making of the lampstand or menorah, which was made of pure gold. It had a central stem with six branches, each with a lamp on the end, for a total of seven lamps. The lampstand was decorated with almond blossoms, buds, and flowers.

Verses 25-28 describe the making of the altar of incense, which was made of acacia wood and covered with gold. It had a border of gold around it and four gold rings for carrying it. The altar had a golden grate on top and horns on the corners.

Finally, in verses 29-38, Bezalel and Oholiab made the anointing oil and the incense for the Tabernacle according to God's instructions. These were sacred items that were used in the worship of God and were not to be duplicated or used for personal purposes.

The main theme of this chapter is the completion of the Tabernacle and its furnishings according to God's instructions. The Israelites were to worship God in a specific way, using specific items that were made with great care and skill. The Tabernacle was a symbol of God's presence among the Israelites and a reminder of their covenant with Him.

To understand this chapter, it is important to know the historical and cultural context of the Israelites at that time. They had just been delivered from slavery in Egypt and were on their way to the Promised Land. The Tabernacle was a portable structure that could be set up and taken down as they journeyed through the wilderness.

Theologians, scholars, and religious leaders have interpreted this chapter as a symbol of God's presence among His people and a reminder of His covenant with them. The furnishings of the Tabernacle represent the various aspects of worship, such as the Ark representing God's law and the lampstand representing God's light.

There are no significant characters or events in this chapter, but the symbols and items described are significant in the history of the Israelites and in the worship of God.

One lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of following God's instructions and using the items He has designated for worship. The Israelites were not to worship God in any way they pleased, but rather in the way He had commanded. This applies to us today as well, as we are called to worship God in spirit and in truth (John 4:24).

In conclusion, Exodus 37 describes the completion of the Tabernacle and its furnishings according to God's instructions. It is a reminder of God's presence among His people and the importance of worshiping Him in the way He has designated.

## Summary

Exodus chapter 30 begins with instructions for constructing an altar for burning incense out of acacia wood. This altar was to be placed in the Holy Place of the tabernacle, before the veil that separated it from the Most Holy Place. The altar was to be overlaid with pure gold, and there were to be horns on its four corners. The priests were to burn incense on this altar every morning and evening, and the incense was to be made of a specific mixture of spices, including frankincense, stacte, onycha, and galbanum.

The chapter then goes on to describe the census tax that was to be collected from every Israelite who was counted in a census. Each person was to give half a shekel of silver, which was to be used for the service of the tabernacle. This tax was seen as a way of atoning for their souls, and it was to be collected once a year.

Next, the chapter describes the basin that was to be used for washing the priests' hands and feet before they entered the tabernacle. The basin was to be made of bronze and placed between the altar and the tabernacle. The priests were to wash their hands and feet before performing any service in the tabernacle, so that they would be clean and pure.

Finally, the chapter describes the anointing oil that was to be used to consecrate the tabernacle and all of its furnishings, as well as the priests who served in it. The oil was made of a specific mixture of spices, including myrrh, cinnamon, and cassia, and it was to be used only for this purpose. Anyone who used this oil or made a similar mixture for their own use would be cut off from the people of Israel.

In terms of structure, the chapter is organized into four main sections: the altar of incense, the census tax, the basin, and the anointing oil. Each section contains specific instructions and details, and each is related to the overall theme of the chapter, which is the importance of purity and holiness in the service of God.

There are several key verses in this chapter, including Exodus 30:10, which states: "And Aaron shall make atonement upon its horns once a year; he shall make atonement upon it with the blood of the sin offering of atonement once a year throughout your generations. It is most holy to the Lord." This verse emphasizes the importance of atonement and the role of the altar of incense in this process.

Another key verse is Exodus 30:22-23, which describes the specific ingredients that were to be used in the anointing oil: "Moreover the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: ‘Also take for yourself quality spices—five hundred shekels of liquid myrrh, half as much sweet-smelling cinnamon (two hundred and fifty shekels), two hundred and fifty shekels of sweet-smelling cane.'"

One significant character in this chapter is Aaron, who is mentioned several times as the one who is to perform various rituals and make atonement on the altar of incense. The chapter also contains several important symbols, including the incense, which represents prayer and worship, and the anointing oil, which symbolizes consecration and holiness.

The main themes of this chapter are purity, holiness, and atonement. The instructions for the altar of incense, the census tax, the basin, and the anointing oil all emphasize the importance of being clean and pure in the service of God. The chapter also emphasizes the role of atonement in this process, both through the use of the altar of incense and the census tax.

To fully understand this chapter, it is important to consider its historical and cultural context. The instructions for the tabernacle and its furnishings were given to Moses by God while the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness after their escape from Egypt. The tabernacle was meant to be a portable sanctuary where God could dwell among his people, and the instructions for its construction and use were meant to reflect God's holiness and the Israelites' need for purity and atonement.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter in a variety of ways, but most agree that it emphasizes the importance of purity and holiness in the service of God. Some have also seen the instructions for the anointing oil as a foreshadowing of Christ, who was anointed by God for his ministry.

One controversy related to this chapter is the use of incense in Christian worship. Some churches use incense as a symbol of prayer and worship, while others do not. Some also see the use of the census tax as an example of the importance of supporting the work of the church through giving.

This chapter relates to other chapters and themes in the Bible, particularly those related to the tabernacle and the importance of purity and holiness in the worship of God. It also foreshadows the role of Christ as the ultimate sacrifice for sin and the importance of atonement in Christian theology.

In terms of lessons and morals, this chapter emphasizes the importance of being clean and pure in our worship of God, as well as the need for atonement and the support of the work of the church. It also reminds us of the importance of consecration and holiness in our own lives as we seek to serve God.

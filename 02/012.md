## Summary

Exodus 12 is a pivotal chapter in the book of Exodus and the history of the Israelites. It details the institution of the Passover, which became a significant feast day for the Jewish people, and the events leading up to the exodus from Egypt.

The first section of the chapter, from verse 1, describes the institution of the Passover. God instructs Moses and Aaron to tell the Israelites to select a lamb without blemish, slaughter it at twilight, and spread its blood on the doorposts and lintels of their homes. They are to roast the lamb and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, and to do so with their loins girded, sandals on their feet, and staff in their hand. God also declares that this day shall be a memorial for the Israelites, and that they shall keep it as a feast day throughout their generations.

The chapter then moves to the events leading up to the exodus from Egypt, starting from verse 31. In response to the tenth and final plague, Pharaoh finally allows the Israelites to leave Egypt. The Israelites are instructed to ask their Egyptian neighbors for silver and gold articles, and they are given them willingly. The Israelites then leave Egypt with their flocks and herds, and a mixed multitude of people join them.

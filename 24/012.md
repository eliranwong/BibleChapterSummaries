Jeremiah 12 is a chapter in the book of Jeremiah, which primarily contains the prophecies and messages of the prophet Jeremiah to the people of Judah, warning them of their impending destruction and exile. This chapter focuses on Jeremiah's personal struggles and questions about the justice of God in light of the prosperity of the wicked and the suffering of the righteous.

The chapter begins with Jeremiah questioning why the wicked prosper and the faithful suffer. He laments that the land is full of violence and that even the animals have turned against him. In verse 5, God responds to Jeremiah by telling him that if he can't handle what is happening in the land now, he has no chance of surviving when the situation gets worse. God then goes on to tell Jeremiah that he will have to contend with his own family members who have turned against him.

The verses in this chapter are organized into a back-and-forth dialogue between Jeremiah and God. Jeremiah's complaints and questions are interspersed with God's responses and warnings.

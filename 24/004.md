Judgment through drought:
The first section of the chapter, from verse 1 to 31, talks about the judgment that God will bring upon the people of Judah. In the beginning, God calls upon the people to return to Him and remove their abominations. If they do so, they will be restored to Him. However, if they continue in their sinful ways, they will face His wrath.

God warns the people of Judah that He will bring a drought upon them, and the land will become desolate. The people will be helpless, and there will be no relief from the scorching sun. The chapter describes how the animals and birds will suffer due to the drought, and the people will be left with nothing to eat or drink.

Verse 9: "And it shall be in that day," says the Lord, "That the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder."

Spiritual ignorance of Judah:
The second section of the chapter, from verse 29 to 31, talks about the spiritual ignorance of the people of Judah. The people have become so steeped in their sins that they cannot recognize the judgment that is coming upon them. They have become like a stubborn mule that refuses to turn back.

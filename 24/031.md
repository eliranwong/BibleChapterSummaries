2. Verses 10-20: In the second section, God promises to gather his people from all over the world and bring them back to their land. He promises to be a father to the fatherless and a husband to the widow. He will satisfy the hungry and the thirsty and lead his people beside streams of water.

3. Verses 21-30: In the third section, God promises to establish a new covenant with his people. He says that he will write his law on their hearts and forgive their sins. The people of Israel will no longer need to teach each other about God because everyone will know him. God promises to bless the descendants of Jacob and establish them as a nation forever.

4. Verses 31-40: In the final section, God promises to establish a new covenant with his people that will be different from the covenant made with their ancestors. This new covenant will not be written on tablets of stone, but on the hearts of God's people. God promises that his people will never be cast out of his presence again.

## Summary

Jeremiah 21 is a message from the Lord to King Zedekiah of Judah, delivered through the prophet Jeremiah. The chapter is primarily focused on the impending destruction of Jerusalem and the judgment that will befall the people of Judah.

The chapter begins with King Zedekiah sending a delegation to Jeremiah to inquire about the outcome of a potential battle with the Babylonians. However, the Lord responds through Jeremiah that He will not help the people of Judah in their time of distress, and that the Babylonians will ultimately succeed in their siege of Jerusalem.

The verses of this chapter are structured as a conversation between King Zedekiah and the Lord, relayed through the prophet Jeremiah. The chapter is organized into three distinct sections: 
1) The Lord's response to King Zedekiah's delegation (verses 1-7)
2) A warning to the people of Judah about the impending destruction of Jerusalem (verses 8-10)
3) A call to repentance and submission to the will of the Lord (verses 11-14).

Key verses in this chapter include verse 3, where the Lord declares, "I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand and strong arm, in anger and in fury and in great wrath," and verse 10, where Jeremiah delivers the message that "I have set my face against this city for harm and not for good, declares the Lord."

The characters in this chapter are primarily King Zedekiah, Jeremiah, and the Lord. The events described in the chapter center around the impending destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians.

The main theme of this chapter is the judgment of God upon the people of Judah for their disobedience and idolatry. The Lord warns the people of Judah that their destruction is imminent and that they should repent and turn back to Him.

The historical context of this chapter is important to understand the message that the Lord is delivering through Jeremiah. At the time, Babylon was a powerful empire that was threatening the existence of Judah. The people of Judah were divided and struggling to maintain their independence and religious identity. The Lord's message through Jeremiah was a warning to the people of Judah that their disobedience and unfaithfulness would have severe consequences.

Theological interpretations of this chapter vary, but most agree that the judgment of God upon the people of Judah was a result of their disobedience and idolatry. Some scholars also see this chapter as a warning to all people to turn back to God and submit to His will.

Controversies related to this chapter include debates over the historicity of the events described and the accuracy of the prophetic messages delivered by Jeremiah.

Jeremiah 21 is closely related to other chapters in the book of Jeremiah that describe the judgment of God upon the people of Judah and the destruction of Jerusalem. It is also connected to themes of repentance, obedience, and the sovereignty of God that are present throughout the Bible.

The main lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God. The people of Judah suffered the consequences of their disobedience, and this chapter serves as a warning to all people to turn back to God and submit to His will.

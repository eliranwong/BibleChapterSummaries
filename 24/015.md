From verse 10 - Jeremiah's complaint and reassurance

## Summary

Jeremiah 15 is a chapter that begins with the Lord speaking to the prophet Jeremiah, stating that even if great leaders like Moses and Samuel were to intercede for the people of Judah, He would not look favorably upon them. The Lord commands Jeremiah to send the people away from His presence and let them go.

From verse 10, we see Jeremiah's complaint and reassurance. Jeremiah is feeling overwhelmed and distraught about the harsh treatment he has received from the people of Judah. He laments that he has been a faithful servant of the Lord and has not sat with the wicked, yet he is still suffering. He questions the Lord's justice and wonders why the wicked prosper and the righteous suffer.

The Lord responds to Jeremiah's complaint by reassuring him that he will be protected and that he must continue to trust in the Lord's plan. The Lord warns Jeremiah that he will face further opposition from the people of Judah but encourages him to remain steadfast in his faith.

The verses in this chapter are structured in a dialogue format between the Lord and Jeremiah, with Jeremiah expressing his concerns and the Lord providing reassurance and guidance.

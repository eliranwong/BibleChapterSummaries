## Summary

Habakkuk 3 is a prayer by the prophet Habakkuk, following the style of Shigionoth. This chapter can be divided into five sections, each revealing different aspects of God's character and actions.

The first section, from verse 1 to 2, reveals Habakkuk's request for mercy. He pleads with God to remember His mercy and to continue to work on behalf of His people. Habakkuk acknowledges that God's ways are mysterious, but he trusts in God's ultimate plan.

In the second section, from verse 3 to 7, Habakkuk reflects on God's past acts of deliverance. He recalls God's power and might, as evidenced in His deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt and His protection of His people from their enemies.

The third section, from verse 8 to 10, emphasizes the power of God over nature. Habakkuk describes the earth trembling at God's presence, and the mountains and seas being moved by His power. This highlights God's sovereignty over all of creation.

The fourth section, from verse 11 to 15, depicts the Lord as the divine warrior. Habakkuk vividly describes God's wrath against His enemies, and the defeat of the wicked. This section shows that God is not only merciful, but also just.

The final section, from verse 16 to 19, expresses Habakkuk's anticipation of future deliverance. He recognizes that difficult times may come, but ultimately, he trusts in God's salvation. Habakkuk ends his prayer with a triumphant declaration of faith in God's power and goodness.

The main themes of Habakkuk 3 include trust in God's mercy and power, reflection on God's past acts of deliverance, and anticipation of future salvation. It also emphasizes that God is both merciful and just, and that He is sovereign over all of creation.

The historical context of Habakkuk 3 is the Babylonian invasion of Judah. Habakkuk was a prophet during this time, and he was struggling to understand why God would allow the Babylonians to conquer His people. This chapter reflects Habakkuk's wrestling with these difficult questions, and his ultimate trust in God's plan.

Scholars have interpreted Habakkuk 3 in different ways. Some see it as a hymn of praise, while others view it as a lament. Some believe that it is a description of a future victory over the Babylonians, while others see it as a reflection on God's ultimate victory over evil.

One controversial interpretation of Habakkuk 3 is the use of the phrase "Selah" in verses 3 and 9. The meaning of this word is unclear, and scholars have debated its significance. Some suggest that it is a musical notation, while others believe it is a call to reflection or meditation.

Habakkuk 3 relates to other chapters and themes in the Bible, particularly those that emphasize God's sovereignty and deliverance. It also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who would ultimately bring salvation to His people.

The lessons and morals that can be taken from Habakkuk 3 include the importance of trust in God's plan, even when it is difficult to understand. It also shows the need for both mercy and justice, and the ultimate victory of God over evil.

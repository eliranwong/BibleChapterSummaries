Overview:
Acts 3 describes the healing of a lame beggar by Peter and John, followed by Peter's second sermon in which he preaches the gospel message to the people who witnessed the miracle. The chapter takes place after the events of Pentecost, where the Holy Spirit descended on the apostles and empowered them to spread the message of Jesus Christ.

The first section includes the description of the beggar's condition, the healing, and the reaction of the people who witnessed the miracle. The second section includes Peter's speech, in which he explains the significance of the healing and the message of salvation.

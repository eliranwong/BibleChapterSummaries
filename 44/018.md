## Summary

Acts 18 is a continuation of the account of Paul's second missionary journey. This chapter narrates Paul's experiences in Corinth, his return to Antioch, his journey through Asia Minor, and the arrival of Apollos in Corinth.

The chapter opens with Paul leaving Athens and arriving in Corinth, a major trade center in Greece. Here, he meets Aquila and Priscilla, a Jewish couple who had recently arrived from Italy. Paul stays with them and works with them as a tentmaker while also preaching in the synagogue every Sabbath.

In verses 5-8, Paul is joined by Silas and Timothy, and he devotes himself entirely to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ. However, when some of the Jews opposed him and blasphemed, Paul shook his garments and declared that he would go to the Gentiles.

In the following verses, we see that Paul's decision to focus on the Gentiles leads to the conversion of many people, including Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, and his household. The Lord appears to Paul in a vision, assuring him that he will not be harmed in Corinth, and so he continues to preach there for a year and a half.

In verse 18, we see that Paul eventually leaves Corinth and returns to Antioch, where he reports to the church about his experiences in Corinth. After some time, Paul sets out on his third missionary journey, traveling through Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening the disciples.

In verse 24, we are introduced to Apollos, a learned Jew from Alexandria who had come to Ephesus. He was an eloquent speaker and had a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures, but he only knew of John's baptism. Aquila and Priscilla take him aside and explain the way of God to him more accurately. Apollos then goes to Corinth, where he greatly helps those who had believed through grace.

The main themes of Acts 18 are the spread of the gospel to the Gentiles, the importance of preaching the truth of Christ accurately, and the continual strengthening and building up of the church. This chapter also highlights the role of ordinary believers, such as Aquila and Priscilla, who actively participate in advancing the gospel and helping others grow in their faith.

To fully understand and interpret Acts 18, it is important to consider the historical and cultural context of the time. Corinth was a vibrant city, known for its immorality and wealth. The Jews in Corinth were likely influenced by the Greek culture and philosophy, which may have contributed to their resistance to Paul's message.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted Acts 18 as a model for evangelism and discipleship, emphasizing the importance of contextualization and cultural sensitivity in sharing the gospel. Some have also seen the account of Apollos as a reminder of the importance of sound doctrine and theological accuracy.

There have been controversies regarding the role of women in Acts 18, particularly the fact that Priscilla is listed before her husband Aquila in some verses. However, many scholars argue that this is simply a matter of style and not an indication of a reversal of gender roles.

Acts 18 is closely connected to the larger theme of the spread of the gospel to the Gentiles and the growth of the early church. It also foreshadows Paul's eventual journey to Rome, where he will continue to proclaim the gospel even in the face of persecution and opposition.

The lessons and morals that can be taken from Acts 18 include the importance of perseverance in sharing the gospel, the value of working together as a community of believers, and the need for theological accuracy and sound doctrine. It also reminds us that God is faithful to those who obediently serve Him, and He will use even the most unlikely individuals to accomplish His purposes.

## Summary

Overview:
Acts 19 is a chapter in the book of Acts that describes Paul's ministry in Ephesus. Paul arrives in Ephesus and encounters some disciples who had only received John's baptism. He baptizes them in the name of Jesus Christ, and they receive the Holy Spirit. Paul then spends two years preaching and performing miracles in Ephesus, resulting in the growth of the church. However, this also leads to opposition from those who are threatened by the spread of Christianity.

Structure:
The chapter can be divided into three main sections:
1. Paul's arrival in Ephesus and his encounter with the disciples who had only received John's baptism (verses 1-7).
2. Paul's ministry in Ephesus and the growth of the church (verses 8-20).
3. The opposition to Paul and Christianity in Ephesus (verses 21-41).

Key verses:
Verse 11: "And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul."
Verse 20: "So the word of the Lord continued to increase and prevail mightily."

## Summary

3 John 1 is a short letter written by the apostle John to a man named Gaius. This chapter emphasizes the importance of hospitality, faithfulness, and loving others in truth.

Introduction and Greeting (verses 1-2)
The chapter begins with John identifying himself as "the elder" and addressing Gaius as "the beloved, whom I love in truth." This greeting sets the tone for the entire letter, emphasizing the importance of truth and love in relationships.

Gaius Praised for His Hospitality and Faithfulness (verses 3-8)
John then commends Gaius for his hospitality towards traveling missionaries who have come to spread the Gospel. He praises Gaius for his faithful support of these workers, even though they are strangers to him. John encourages Gaius to continue this practice of hospitality and to support these workers in their ministry.

Condemnation of Diotrephes for His Hostility and Selfishness (verses 9-11)
John then turns his attention to a man named Diotrephes who is causing trouble in the church. Diotrephes is described as being hostile to John and the missionaries, refusing to welcome them and even excommunicating those who do. He is also described as being selfish, seeking power and control instead of serving others. John warns Gaius and others not to imitate Diotrephes' behavior, but to follow the example of those who do good.

Commendation of Demetrius for His Good Testimony (verse 12)
John concludes his letter by commending a man named Demetrius, who has a good testimony from everyone, including the truth itself. This suggests that Demetrius is a faithful follower of Christ, and serves as a positive example for others to follow.

Conclusion and Final Greetings (verse 13)
The chapter ends with a short conclusion in which John expresses his desire to speak with Gaius face to face and sends greetings from the friends in his community.

Overall, the main themes of 3 John 1 are hospitality, faithfulness, and the importance of truth and love in relationships. The letter also warns against selfishness and hostility, and encourages followers of Christ to serve others and imitate those who do good.

In terms of historical and cultural context, it is important to note that in the early church, traveling missionaries relied on the hospitality of local believers for food, shelter, and support. This is why John commends Gaius for his hospitality towards these workers. Additionally, the letter reflects the struggles and conflicts that arose in early Christian communities as they navigated issues of leadership and authority.

Interpretations of this chapter vary, but many theologians and scholars see it as a reminder of the importance of living out one's faith in practical ways, such as showing hospitality and love to others. Some have also interpreted the condemnation of Diotrephes as a warning against those who seek power and control in the church, instead of serving others in humility.

In terms of lessons and morals, 3 John 1 teaches us to prioritize truth and love in our relationships with others, to be hospitable and faithful in supporting the work of the Gospel, and to avoid selfishness and hostility in our interactions with others.

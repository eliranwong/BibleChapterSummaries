## Summary

Hebrews 6 is a chapter that discusses the foundation for spiritual maturity and the assurance of God's promises. The author of Hebrews begins the chapter by urging his readers to move beyond the basic teachings they have already received and towards perfection. He warns against laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God, suggesting that these teachings represent the basic tenets of Christianity that should already be known by his audience.

The author then goes on to discuss the consequences of falling away from the faith. He presents an analogy of a field that produces good crops and one that produces thorns and thistles, suggesting that those who fall away from the faith are like the latter, and are in danger of being burned. He then reminds his readers of the good works and love they have shown in the past, and encourages them to continue to do so.

From verse 9 onwards, the author assures his readers that he is confident of better things for them, things that accompany salvation. He encourages them to be diligent in their faith, imitating those who through faith and patience have inherited the promises. He then discusses the certainty of God's promises, using the example of Abraham and his faith in God's promise to give him a son. The author emphasizes that God swore by himself, because there was no one greater to swear by, and that this emphasizes the unchangeable nature of his promise.

The chapter ends with the author encouraging his readers to take hold of the hope set before them, which is like an anchor for the soul. He reminds them that Jesus has gone before them as a forerunner, having entered the inner sanctuary on their behalf.

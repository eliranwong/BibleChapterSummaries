## Summary

Hebrews 10 is a continuation of the author's discussion on the superiority of Christ's sacrifice over the old covenant sacrifices. The chapter can be divided into two parts: Christ's single perfect offering (verses 1-18) and encouragement to persevere (verses 19-39).

In the first section, the author argues that the law and its sacrifices were merely a shadow of the good that was to come, and could never truly make those who came to worship perfect. This is contrasted with Christ's sacrifice, which was a single, perfect offering for sins. The author writes, "But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God" (verse 12). This means that Christ's sacrifice was sufficient to atone for all sins, once and for all, and that there is no longer a need for repeated sacrifices.

The author goes on to explain how Christ's sacrifice has made it possible for us to have confidence in approaching God. He writes, "Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings" (verses 19-22). This is a call to believers to approach God boldly and confidently, knowing that they have been made clean by Christ's sacrifice.

In the second section of the chapter, the author encourages believers to persevere in their faith. He warns against turning away from the truth and returning to the old covenant sacrifices, which were now obsolete. He writes, "If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God" (verses 26-27). This is a sobering reminder that there are consequences for turning away from Christ and rejecting his sacrifice.

The author then encourages believers to continue to hold fast to their faith, even in the face of persecution and suffering. He writes, "Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you endured in a great conflict full of suffering. Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated. You suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions" (verses 32-34). This is a call to persevere in faith, even when it is difficult.

In conclusion, Hebrews 10 is a powerful reminder of the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice and a call to believers to persevere in their faith. It is a reminder that Christ's sacrifice has made it possible for us to approach God confidently and boldly, and that we must continue to hold fast to our faith, even in the face of persecution and suffering.

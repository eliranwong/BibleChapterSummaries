* From verse 1 - Melchizedek and Christ's eternal priesthood

## Summary

Hebrews 7 is a chapter in the New Testament that focuses on the idea of Melchizedek and Christ's eternal priesthood. The chapter begins by introducing Melchizedek as the king of Salem and priest of the Most High God. This is significant because Melchizedek is a figure from the Old Testament who is mentioned briefly in Genesis 14:18-20. The author of Hebrews uses Melchizedek as an example to illustrate the superiority of Christ's priesthood over the Levitical priesthood.

The verses in this chapter are structured in a way that compares and contrasts the priesthood of Melchizedek with that of the Levites. The author of Hebrews uses a logical argument to show how Jesus is the perfect high priest who is able to save completely those who come to God through him.

One of the key verses in this chapter is verse 3, which says, "Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever." This verse is significant because it highlights the mysterious nature of Melchizedek and his eternal priesthood.

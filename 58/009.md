## Summary

Hebrews 9 is a chapter that focuses on the superiority of Christ's sacrifice over the old covenant sacrifices. The author begins by explaining that the old covenant also had regulations for worship and a worldly sanctuary. The chapter then compares the old covenant's sanctuary with the heavenly sanctuary, emphasizing that Christ entered the heavenly sanctuary with His own blood, obtaining eternal redemption for all those who believe in Him.

The verses in this chapter are structured in two parts. The first part, from verse 1 to verse 14, compares the old covenant's sanctuary with the heavenly sanctuary, and explains how Christ's sacrifice is superior to the old covenant's sacrifices. The second part, from verse 15 to the end of the chapter, emphasizes the necessity and effectiveness of Christ's sacrifice.

One of the key verses in this chapter is verse 22, which states, "And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission." This verse emphasizes the importance of blood sacrifice in the Old Testament and how Christ's sacrifice fulfilled this requirement once and for all.

The chapter also mentions significant characters such as Moses, who was given instructions to build the earthly tabernacle, and Christ, who is the High Priest who entered the heavenly sanctuary with His own blood.

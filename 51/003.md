## Summary

Colossians 3 is a chapter in the New Testament that serves as a guide to Christian living. The chapter is divided into several sections, each addressing a specific aspect of Christian living. 

Seek the Things Above (verses 1-4)
The chapter begins with an exhortation to seek the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. This means setting our minds on heavenly things rather than earthly things, because our true life is hidden with Christ in God. This section emphasizes the importance of putting our focus on eternal things and fixing our minds on heavenly realities rather than temporal things.

Put to Death Your Earthly Nature (verses 5-11)
In this section, we are called to put to death our earthly nature, which includes sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, anger, malice, slander, and filthy language. The passage emphasizes the need to rid ourselves of these things since we have been raised with Christ and our old self has died. We are called to put on a new self, which is being renewed in the image of its Creator.

Put on the New Self (verses 12-17)
This section provides a practical guide for putting on the new self. We are called to clothe ourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience, bearing with one another and forgiving each other. Above all, we are to put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. The passage also emphasizes the importance of letting the peace of Christ rule in our hearts and being thankful.

Wives and Husbands (verses 18-19)
This section addresses the roles of wives and husbands in the context of Christian marriage. Wives are called to submit to their husbands, and husbands are called to love their wives and not be harsh with them. This passage emphasizes the need for mutual respect and love in marriage.

Children and Parents (verses 20-21)
This section addresses the roles of children and parents in the family. Children are called to obey their parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. Parents are called not to provoke their children, so they do not become discouraged.

Slaves and Masters (verses 22-25)
This section addresses the roles of slaves and masters in the context of the Roman Empire. Slaves are called to obey their earthly masters as they would obey Christ, doing their work with sincerity of heart. Masters are called to treat their slaves justly and fairly, knowing that they too have a Master in heaven.

The main themes of Colossians 3 are the call to seek heavenly things, putting to death our old nature and putting on the new self, living in harmony with others, and fulfilling our roles in the family and workplace.

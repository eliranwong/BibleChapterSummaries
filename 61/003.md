Reminder and Mockers in the Last Days (verses 1-4)
Peter begins by reminding the readers about the teachings of the apostles and the prophecies about the coming of false teachers in the last days. He encourages the readers to remember the words spoken by the holy prophets and the commandments of the Lord and Savior through the apostles. Peter warns that in the last days, scoffers will come, who will live according to their own lusts and mock the idea of the second coming of Christ.

God's Timing and the Day of the Lord (verses 5-9)
Peter explains that the false teachers deny the possibility of the second coming of Christ and the judgment that will follow. However, Peter reminds the readers that just as God created the world by His word, He will also bring the end of the world by His word. Peter assures the readers that the delay in the second coming of Christ is not a sign of God's slackness but rather His patience and desire for all people to repent and be saved.

The Coming Judgment (verses 10-13)
Peter describes the coming of the day of the Lord, which will be like a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat. The earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. Peter urges the readers to live in holiness and godliness, looking forward to the coming of the day of God.

Call to Holy Living (verse 14)
Peter encourages the readers to be diligent in their pursuit of holiness and to be found blameless and at peace when Christ returns. He warns them not to be led astray by the error of the wicked but to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Exhortation to Understand Scripture (verses 15-16)
Peter acknowledges that some of the things that Paul wrote are hard to understand and that the ignorant and unstable twist and distort them to their own destruction. He advises the readers to be careful and not to be carried away by the error of lawless people but to grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ.

Encouragement to Grow in Grace and Knowledge (verse 17)
Peter encourages the readers to be on their guard so that they are not led astray by the error of the wicked but to grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ. He reminds them that they have been forewarned and exhorts them to be steadfast in their faith.

Peter concludes the letter with a doxology, emphasizing the glory and majesty of God. He writes, "But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen."

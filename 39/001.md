## Summary

Malachi 1 is a prophetic book in the Old Testament, consisting of a series of dialogues between God and the Israelites. It is believed to have been written around 430 BC and is the last book of the Old Testament written before the coming of Christ. The chapter begins with a pronouncement by the Lord to Israel through the prophet Malachi.

Prologue: The word of the Lord to Malachi
The first verse of the chapter is the prologue, which introduces the book as a word from the Lord to Israel through the prophet Malachi. The name Malachi means "my messenger," and he is the last of the twelve minor prophets in the Old Testament.

God's love demonstrated
Verses 2-5 describe God's love for Israel and how it has been demonstrated throughout history. God reminds the Israelites that He chose Jacob over Esau and that He has always loved them. However, the Israelites have not shown their love for God in return. They have offered blemished sacrifices and failed to honor Him as their father and master.

Edom's destruction
In verses 4-5, God pronounces judgment on Edom, the nation descended from Esau. He says that He will tear down their borders and leave their land desolate because of their pride and arrogance. This judgment on Edom serves as a reminder to the Israelites of the consequences of disobedience.

Priests' disrespect towards God
Verses 6-8 address the priests and their lack of respect for God. The priests have offered defiled food and animals as sacrifices, showing contempt for God's name and His altar. God says that He would rather they shut the temple doors than offer such sacrifices. The priests are admonished for their lack of reverence and warned that they will be cursed if they continue to dishonor God.

The worthlessness of their offerings
Verses 9-14 focus on the worthlessness of the offerings that the Israelites have been presenting to God. They have been bringing blind, lame, and sick animals as sacrifices, which is a violation of the law. God says that He would rather they shut the temple doors than offer such sacrifices. He reminds them that He is a great king who deserves better than such offerings.

In conclusion, Malachi 1 is a prophetic book that speaks to the Israelites about their disobedience and lack of reverence towards God. The chapter highlights God's love for His people, His judgment on those who disobey, and the importance of offering proper sacrifices. The themes of obedience, reverence, and love for God are emphasized throughout the chapter. Malachi's message is still relevant today as we strive to be obedient and show reverence to God in all that we do.

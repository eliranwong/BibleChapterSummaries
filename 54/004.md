1 Timothy 4 is a chapter in the New Testament letter of 1 Timothy, written by Paul to Timothy, a young pastor whom Paul had left in charge of the church in Ephesus. This chapter contains warnings about apostasy, instructions for a godly minister, and guidance on Timothy's personal conduct.

The chapter begins with a warning about apostasy, with Paul telling Timothy that in later times, some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons. Paul urges Timothy to combat these false teachings by instructing the believers in sound doctrine, warning them against myths and empty talk, and reminding them to train themselves in godliness.

Moving on to instructions for a godly minister, Paul tells Timothy that he should not neglect his own spiritual growth, but rather should set an example for the believers in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity. Paul also encourages Timothy to devote himself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, and to teaching, and to use his spiritual gift for the benefit of the church.

In verse 11, Paul shifts his focus to Timothy's personal conduct, instructing him to command and teach these things with authority. Paul encourages Timothy to not let anyone look down on him because he is young, but rather to set an example in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity.

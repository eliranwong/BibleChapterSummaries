Instructions to Slaves
In the opening verse of the chapter, Paul instructs slaves to respect and honor their masters. He emphasizes that this is important to prevent any blasphemy against God and His teachings.

False Teachers and Greed
In verse 3, Paul warns Timothy about false teachers who have an unhealthy obsession with controversies and disputes.

Paul instructs Timothy to avoid such teachers and to focus on promoting godliness and love.

True Contentment and Godliness

Pursuit of Godliness

Instructions to the Rich
In verses 17-19, Paul instructs those who are wealthy to be generous and to use their wealth to do good and to help others. He emphasizes the importance of storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth.

Safeguarding the Deposit of Faith

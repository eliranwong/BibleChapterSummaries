## Summary

1 Samuel 21 begins with David fleeing from Saul and seeking refuge with Ahimelech the priest in Nob. Ahimelech is surprised to see David alone and questions him about his situation. David lies to Ahimelech, saying that he is on a secret mission from Saul and that his men are waiting for him elsewhere. Ahimelech offers David bread and a weapon, not realizing that the weapon is the sword of Goliath, which David had taken after defeating him. 

As David is leaving, he is spotted by one of Saul's servants, Doeg the Edomite, who reports to Saul that Ahimelech had helped David. Saul summons Ahimelech and his fellow priests and accuses them of conspiring with David against him. When they deny any wrongdoing, Saul orders his guards to kill them, but they refuse. Doeg, however, carries out the order and kills all the priests, along with their families and livestock. 

In the second half of the chapter, David flees to the Philistine city of Gath, where he pretends to be insane to avoid being captured. The king of Gath, Achish, is deceived by David's act and allows him to leave.

The chapter is structured in two main sections, with the first focusing on David's interactions with Ahimelech and the tragic consequences that follow, and the second on David's escape to Gath and his feigned insanity. 

Key verses in the chapter include verse 8, where David asks Ahimelech for bread, saying "there is no common bread on hand; but there is holy bread, if the young men have kept themselves from women", and verse 15, where Achish tells his courtiers, "Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence?" 

The main themes of the chapter include the dangers of lying and deception, the consequences of association with David, and the importance of finding refuge in times of trouble. 

The chapter takes place during a tumultuous period in Israel's history, when Saul was king and David was on the run from him. It is important to note that the priests of Nob were descendants of Eli, who had been the high priest during the time of Samuel, and that their slaughter represents a significant loss for Israel's religious leadership. 

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter in various ways. Some have seen it as a cautionary tale about the dangers of lying and the consequences of one's actions. Others have focused on the themes of refuge and the importance of seeking out trustworthy allies in times of trouble. 

There are no significant controversies or alternative interpretations of this chapter that are widely known. 

1 Samuel 21 is closely connected to the preceding chapter, where David first becomes aware of Saul's intention to kill him and flees to Samuel for guidance. It is also related to later chapters where David interacts with the Philistines and ultimately becomes king of Israel. 

One lesson that can be drawn from this chapter is the importance of honesty and integrity, even in difficult situations. David's lies to Ahimelech ultimately lead to the deaths of many innocent people, and his later feigned insanity is a reminder that deception can have unintended consequences. Additionally, the chapter highlights the dangers of associating with those who are opposed to God's will, as Ahimelech and his fellow priests were caught in the crossfire of David's conflict with Saul.

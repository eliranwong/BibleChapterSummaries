David seeks refuge and answers from Jonathan, who is Saul's son and David's loyal friend.

The chapter is structured around the conversation between Jonathan and David, as they discuss the reasons behind Saul's attempts to kill David. Jonathan is torn between his loyalty to his father and his friendship with David, but ultimately decides to help David escape. They make a covenant to protect each other, with David promising to show kindness to Jonathan's descendants if he survives Saul's wrath.

One of the key verses in the chapter is verse 17, where Jonathan says to David, "And you shall not only show me the kindness of the Lord while I still live, that I may not die; but you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever, no, not when the Lord has cut off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth."

The characters of David, Jonathan, and Saul all play significant roles in this chapter. David is portrayed as a courageous and faithful servant of God who is being persecuted for no reason. Jonathan is torn between his loyalty to his father and his friendship with David, but ultimately chooses to side with David.

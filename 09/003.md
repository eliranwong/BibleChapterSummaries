## Summary

1 Samuel 3: The Lord Calls Samuel

Overview:
The chapter narrates the story of how Samuel was called by God to be a prophet. Samuel was a young boy serving the priest, Eli, in the temple. One night, God called Samuel's name, but Samuel thought it was Eli. After this happened three times, Eli realized that God was calling Samuel and instructed him to respond to God, saying, "Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening." Then God spoke to Samuel, revealing a message about the judgment that would come upon Eli's family.

Verses Structure:
The chapter is divided into two parts. The first part (verses 1-14) describes how God called Samuel, and the second part (verses 15-21) shows how Samuel's prophecy was fulfilled.

Key Verses:
- "And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, 'Here I am, for you called me.' Then Eli perceived that the Lord was calling the boy. Therefore Eli said to Samuel, 'Go, lie down, and if he calls you, you shall say, "Speak, Lord, for your servant hears."' So Samuel went and lay down in his place." (verses 8-9)
- "And the Lord said to Samuel, 'Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which the two ears of everyone who hears it will tingle. On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end. And I declare to him that I am about to punish his house forever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them." (verses 11-13)

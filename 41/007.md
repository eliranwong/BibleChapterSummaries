Overview:

Mark 7 is a chapter that covers various teachings and miracles of Jesus. The chapter begins with a confrontation between Jesus and the Pharisees and scribes who criticize Jesus and his disciples for not following the traditions of the elders regarding handwashing. Jesus responds by challenging their hypocrisy and emphasizing the importance of inner purity rather than external actions. The chapter also includes the healing of a gentile woman's daughter, the healing of a deaf and mute man, and the feeding of four thousand people.

Structure:

The chapter can be divided into two main sections. The first section, from verse 1 to 30, focuses on Jesus' teachings on clean and unclean and his encounter with the Pharisees and scribes. The second section, from verse 31 to 37, describes two miracles performed by Jesus.

Key Verses:

- "Hear me, all of you, and understand: there is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him." (Mark 7:14-15)
- "For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person." (Mark 7:21-23)
- "And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, 'Ephphatha,' that is, 'Be opened.'" (Mark 7:34)

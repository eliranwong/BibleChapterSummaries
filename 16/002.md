## Summary

Nehemiah 2 is a chapter that tells the story of Nehemiah's journey to Jerusalem to rebuild the walls of the city. It begins with Nehemiah serving wine to King Artaxerxes and the king noticing his sadness. The king asks Nehemiah what is wrong and Nehemiah tells him that he is sad because the walls of Jerusalem are in ruins. The king then asks Nehemiah what he wants and Nehemiah prays to God for courage and asks the king for permission to go to Jerusalem to rebuild the walls.

The chapter is structured in a chronological narrative, with each section of the chapter following Nehemiah's journey from requesting permission from the king to arriving in Jerusalem and inspecting the walls.

One key passage in the chapter is verse 8, where Nehemiah asks the king for letters to ensure safe passage and support for his journey to Jerusalem. Another key passage is verse 18, where Nehemiah tells the people of Jerusalem about the good hand of God upon him.

Nehemiah is the main character in the chapter, as he is the one who leads the effort to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. King Artaxerxes and Sanballat and Tobiah are also significant characters in the chapter, as they play a role in Nehemiah's journey and the opposition he faces in rebuilding the walls.

The main themes of the chapter are courage, prayer, and perseverance in the face of opposition. Nehemiah prays for courage and relies on God to help him in his journey. He also faces opposition from Sanballat and Tobiah, but he remains steadfast in his mission to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.

It is important to understand the historical and cultural context of the chapter, as it takes place during the Persian Empire and the rebuilding of Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. Nehemiah is a Jewish exile who serves as the cupbearer to the king of Persia.

Theologians and scholars interpret this chapter as a story of faith, leadership, and perseverance. It is also seen as a symbol of the restoration of the Jewish people and their connection to God.

There are controversies surrounding the chapter, particularly in regards to the accuracy of the historical account and the role of Nehemiah in the rebuilding of the walls.

Nehemiah 2 relates to other chapters and themes in the Bible, particularly the theme of restoration and redemption. It is also connected to the book of Ezra, which tells the story of the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem.

The main lesson that can be taken from Nehemiah 2 is the importance of prayer and faith in times of adversity. Nehemiah's reliance on God and his perseverance in the face of opposition serve as an inspiration for believers today to trust in God and remain steadfast in their faith.

The chapter can be divided into six sections, each with its own focus and message.

Social Reforms (verses 1-3)
The first section of the chapter begins with the reading of the book of Moses to the people. Nehemiah discovers that the law states that Ammonites and Moabites are not to be admitted into the assembly of God. He immediately puts this law into effect and expels the Ammonites and Moabites who had been living among the Israelites. This section highlights the importance of following the laws of God and the need for social reforms.

Repurification of the Temple Chambers (verses 4-9)
The second section of the chapter focuses on the repurification of the Temple chambers. Nehemiah discovers that one of the chambers had been given to Tobiah, an Ammonite who had previously opposed the rebuilding of the wall. Nehemiah throws Tobiah's belongings out of the chamber and orders it to be purified. This section emphasizes the need for purity and the importance of dedicating holy spaces to God.

Support for the Levites (verses 10-14)
The third section of the chapter deals with the support for the Levites. Nehemiah discovers that the Levites have not been receiving their portions of the tithes and offerings. He confronts the officials and the people and orders them to give the Levites what is rightfully theirs. This section highlights the importance of supporting those who serve God.

Sabbath Reforms (verses 15-22)
The fourth section of the chapter deals with Sabbath reforms. Nehemiah discovers that the people have been working on the Sabbath and buying and selling goods on that day. He confronts the people and orders them to keep the Sabbath holy. This section emphasizes the importance of keeping the Sabbath and the need to set aside time for rest and worship.

Correcting Mixed Marriages (verses 23-29)
The fifth section of the chapter deals with mixed marriages. Nehemiah discovers that some of the Israelites have married women from other nations. He confronts the men and orders them to put away their foreign wives and children. This section emphasizes the importance of remaining separate from the nations around them and the need to preserve the purity of the Israelite community.

Nehemiah's Final Reforms and Prayer (verses 30-31)
The final section of the chapter deals with Nehemiah's final reforms and prayer. Nehemiah prays for God's mercy and asks God to remember him for his faithfulness. This section emphasizes the importance of prayer and the need for God's mercy and grace.

In summary, Nehemiah 13 is a chapter that focuses on the need for social, spiritual, and moral reforms. It emphasizes the importance of following God's laws, supporting those who serve God, keeping holy spaces pure, setting aside time for rest and worship, remaining separate from the nations around them, and relying on God's mercy and grace.

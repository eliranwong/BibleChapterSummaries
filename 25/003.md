In the second section, from verse 19 to 27, the prophet shifts his focus to God's faithfulness. He remembers God's mercies and compassion, and how they are new every morning. He acknowledges his own sinfulness but hopes in God's love and mercy to restore him and the people.

The third section, from verse 28 to 33, speaks of the prophet's submission to God's discipline. He recognizes that it is good for him to bear the yoke that God has laid upon him, and he submits to God's will, trusting that it is for his ultimate good.

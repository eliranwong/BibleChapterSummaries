## Summary

1 Kings chapter 3 is a narrative of the reign of King Solomon, the son of David. The chapter begins with Solomon forming a marriage alliance with Pharaoh of Egypt by taking his daughter as his wife. The marriage was strategic to form a political alliance between Israel and Egypt. After the marriage, Solomon began building the house of the Lord and the wall around Jerusalem.

Solomon's request for wisdom (verses 3-15)
In verse 3, we see that Solomon loved the Lord and walked in the statutes of his father David, except for offering sacrifices at the high places. One day, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream and asked him what he wanted. Solomon replied that he needed wisdom to govern the people of Israel and to discern between good and evil.

God was pleased with Solomon's request and granted him wisdom beyond measure. In verse 12, God said to Solomon, "Behold, I have given you a wise and discerning heart, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor shall one like you arise after you."

Solomon's wisdom was tested in the judgment of two harlots who came before him with a baby. One of the harlots claimed that the other had smothered her baby during the night and switched it with hers. The other harlot denied the claim. Solomon then ordered that the baby be cut in half and given to both women. The true mother revealed herself by saying that she would rather give up the baby than see it harmed. Solomon then gave the baby to the true mother and the people of Israel revered him for his wisdom (verses 16-28).

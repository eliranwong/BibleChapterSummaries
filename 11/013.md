## Summary

1 Kings 13 is a chapter in the Old Testament book of 1 Kings. The chapter tells the story of a prophetic encounter between a man of God from Judah and King Jeroboam of Israel. The chapter is structured in two parts, the first from verse 1 to 32, and the second from verse 33 to the end.

The first part of the chapter tells the story of the man of God from Judah who prophesies against the altar that Jeroboam has built in Bethel. The man of God delivers a message from the Lord, declaring that a son of David, named Josiah, will come and destroy the altar and the false priests who serve there. The man of God also performs a miraculous sign, causing the altar to split in two and the ashes to pour out.

Jeroboam is enraged by the man of God's words and his miraculous sign. He stretches out his hand to arrest the man of God, but his hand withers and becomes useless. The man of God then departs, refusing to eat or drink in Jeroboam's presence, in obedience to the word of the Lord.

The second part of the chapter begins with Jeroboam offering to reward the man of God for his prophetic words and his sign. However, the man of God refuses, stating that the Lord has commanded him not to eat or drink in that place, nor to return by the way he came.

An old prophet living in Bethel hears of the man of God's actions and decides to seek him out. The old prophet lies to the man of God, claiming that an angel has commanded him to invite the man of God to his house to eat and drink. The man of God initially refuses, but the old prophet convinces him to come to his house.

While they are eating, the word of the Lord comes to the old prophet, condemning him for disobeying the commandment not to eat or drink in that place. The old prophet prophesies that the man of God will die and be buried in the tomb of his fathers. After they finish eating, the man of God sets out on his journey, but is attacked and killed by a lion on the way.

The chapter concludes with the old prophet mourning the man of God's death and requesting that he be buried in his own tomb. The chapter ends with the statement that Jeroboam did not turn from his evil ways, but continued to appoint priests from among all the people, rather than from the tribe of Levi.

The main themes of 1 Kings 13 include obedience to the word of the Lord, the consequences of disobedience, false worship, and the judgment of God. The chapter highlights the importance of obeying God's commands, even in the face of opposition or temptation. It also emphasizes the seriousness of false worship and the consequences that come from disobeying God's commands.

The historical context of 1 Kings 13 is important to understand the significance of the prophecy against Jeroboam's altar. Jeroboam was the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the nation was divided following the death of Solomon. Jeroboam had set up two golden calves for the people of Israel to worship, in order to prevent them from returning to Jerusalem, the capital of the southern kingdom of Judah. The altar in Bethel was part of this idolatrous worship, and the man of God's prophecy against it was a warning of the judgment that would come upon the nation as a result of their disobedience.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted 1 Kings 13 as a warning against false worship and disobedience to God's commands. Some have also seen the story of the old prophet's deception as a warning against false prophets who seek to lead God's people astray. There are no major controversies related to this chapter, but it is often used to teach lessons about obedience, faithfulness, and the importance of heeding God's commands.

1 Kings 13 is connected to other chapters in 1 Kings, as well as to other books in the Bible. The prophecy of Josiah, who is mentioned in the chapter, is fulfilled in 2 Kings 23, when Josiah becomes king of Judah and destroys the idolatrous altars in the land. The theme of false worship and idolatry is also present in other books of the Bible, particularly in the prophets, who often warn of the judgment that will come upon those who worship false gods.

The main lesson or moral that can be taken from 1 Kings 13 is the importance of obedience to God's commands and the consequences that come from disobedience. The chapter shows that even those who have been given a message from God can be led astray if they do not remain faithful to His commands. It also emphasizes the seriousness of false worship and the judgment that will come upon those who participate in it.

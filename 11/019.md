## Summary

1 Kings 19 gives an account of Elijah fleeing from Jezebel's threat after he had killed the prophets of Baal. The chapter is divided into two parts; the first section from verses 1-8 describes Elijah's journey to Horeb, and the second part from verses 9-21 describes God's commission and reassurance to Elijah.

In the first section, we see Elijah fleeing to Horeb, the mountain of God, in fear of Jezebel. He was exhausted and prayed for death. However, God sent an angel to provide him with food and water, which gave him the strength to travel for forty days and nights to reach Horeb.

In the second section, God appeared to Elijah and asked him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" (verse 9). Elijah responded by explaining that he had been faithful to God, but the Israelites had turned away from God and killed His prophets. God then instructed Elijah to stand on the mountain, and He passed by. There was a great wind, an earthquake, and a fire, but God was not in any of these. Instead, God spoke to Elijah in a gentle whisper. God reassured Elijah that he was not alone and instructed him to anoint two kings and Elisha as his successor.

The key verse in this chapter is verse 11, where God speaks to Elijah in a gentle whisper. This verse emphasizes the importance of listening to God's voice and paying attention to His subtle movements.

The significant characters in this chapter are Elijah, Jezebel, and God. Elijah is the prophet who had just defeated the prophets of Baal, and Jezebel is the queen who threatened to kill him. God is the one who provides for Elijah, appears to him, and commissions him.

The main themes of this chapter are fear, faithfulness, and God's provision. Elijah was afraid and prayed for death, but God provided him with food and water. Elijah was faithful to God, but the Israelites had turned away from God. However, God reassured Elijah that he was not alone and provided him with a mission.

The historical and cultural context of this chapter is essential to understand the power dynamics between Elijah and Jezebel. Jezebel was a powerful queen who worshipped Baal, and Elijah was a prophet of God. Elijah was challenging the dominant religious practices of the time, which made him a threat to those in power.

Scholars and religious leaders have interpreted this chapter as a lesson on the importance of listening to God's voice and being faithful to Him. It also highlights the importance of rest and self-care, as seen in God's provision of food and water for Elijah.

There are no significant controversies related to this chapter, but some have questioned why God appeared to Elijah in a gentle whisper instead of a more dramatic way.

This chapter relates to other chapters in the Bible, such as 1 Kings 18, which describes Elijah's defeat of the prophets of Baal. It also relates to the theme of God's provision, which is seen throughout the Bible, such as in the Exodus when God provided manna for the Israelites in the wilderness.

The lessons that can be taken from this chapter are the importance of listening to God's voice, being faithful to Him, and trusting in His provision. It also emphasizes the importance of rest and self-care in times of stress and fear.

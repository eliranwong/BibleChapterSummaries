## Summary

1 Kings 21 is a chapter that tells the story of Naboth's vineyard and Ahab's covetousness, followed by Elijah's pronouncement of judgment on Ahab and Jezebel. 

The first section of the chapter from verse 1-16 narrates how Naboth the Jezreelite owned a vineyard, which was located beside the palace of Ahab, the king of Samaria. Ahab desired the vineyard and offered to buy it or exchange it for another vineyard, but Naboth refused to sell it because it was his family's inheritance. Ahab became angry and sullen, and his wife Jezebel came up with a plan to falsify charges against Naboth, leading to his execution. Ahab then took possession of the vineyard.

In the second section of the chapter from verse 17-29, Elijah, a prophet of the Lord, confronted Ahab and pronounced judgment on him and his wife Jezebel for their wickedness and injustice towards Naboth. Elijah prophesied that Ahab's family would be destroyed, and dogs would eat Jezebel's flesh. Ahab repented, and God postponed the judgment until after his death.

The verses in this chapter are structured in a narrative form with a clear storyline. The chapter is divided into two sections, with the first section focusing on Naboth's vineyard and Ahab's covetousness, while the second section focuses on Elijah's pronouncement of judgment on Ahab and Jezebel.

Key verses in this chapter include verse 3, which states "And Naboth said to Ahab, 'The Lord forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers,'" and verse 29, which states "Thus says the Lord: 'In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick your blood, even yours.'"

Naboth, Ahab, and Jezebel are significant characters in this chapter. Naboth is portrayed as a man who valued his family's inheritance and refused to compromise his principles. Ahab is depicted as a king who is consumed by his desire for Naboth's vineyard and is willing to use any means necessary to obtain it. Jezebel is portrayed as a manipulative and wicked queen who plots Naboth's death.

## Summary

1 Corinthians 4 is a chapter in the New Testament that is written by Paul to the church in Corinth. The chapter can be divided into three main sections, each with its own theme and message.

Verse 1 starts with Paul encouraging the Corinthians to view him and the other apostles as "servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God." This theme of faithful servants continues throughout the chapter.

In verses 2-5, Paul discusses the role of judgment in the life of a Christian. He reminds the Corinthians that God is the ultimate judge and that they should not judge one another. Paul emphasizes that he is not even qualified to judge himself, let alone others. This message is reinforced by the statement, "Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes."

From verse 6, the chapter shifts its focus to the contrast in values. Paul points out the difference between the wisdom of the world and the wisdom of God. He notes that the Corinthians are boasting about their spiritual gifts and knowledge, but reminds them that these things are not what truly matter. Instead, Paul encourages them to focus on their faith and love for one another.

In verses 14-21, Paul expresses his fatherly concern for the Corinthians. He reminds them that he is their spiritual father and encourages them to imitate him. He also warns them of false teachers who may try to lead them astray.

The message of 1 Corinthians 4 is clear: Christians should view themselves as faithful servants of Christ, who are not to judge one another and should focus on the wisdom of God rather than the wisdom of the world. Additionally, Paul reminds the Corinthians of the importance of love and warns them of false teachers.

The historical and cultural context of this chapter is important to understand. Corinth was a cosmopolitan city with a diverse population, including Greeks, Jews, and Romans. The church in Corinth was also diverse, with members from different backgrounds and levels of spiritual maturity. This context helps to explain why Paul emphasizes the need for unity and warns against false teachers.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter in various ways. Some have focused on the contrast between the wisdom of the world and the wisdom of God, while others have emphasized the importance of love and unity within the church. Some have also noted Paul's humility in admitting that he is not even qualified to judge himself.

One controversy related to this chapter is the interpretation of "the mysteries of God" mentioned in verse 1. Some have suggested that this refers to secret knowledge that only the apostles possess, while others believe that it refers to the gospel message that is now open to all believers.

1 Corinthians 4 is closely related to other chapters in the book that emphasize the importance of unity, love, and faith in Christ. It is also related to the broader themes of the New Testament, including salvation, redemption, and the coming of the kingdom of God.

The main lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of humility, love, and faith in the life of a Christian. We should view ourselves as faithful servants of Christ, who are not to judge one another but to focus on the wisdom of God. Additionally, we should be wary of false teachers and prioritize our love for one another above all else.

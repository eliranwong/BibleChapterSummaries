## Summary

1 Corinthians 14 is a chapter in the New Testament that discusses the importance of prophesy and orderly worship in the Christian church. The Apostle Paul instructs the Corinthians to pursue love and spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophesy. 

The chapter is structured into two main sections, with the first section discussing prophecy and tongues from verse 1, and the second section discussing orderly worship from verse 26. 

In the first section, Paul emphasizes the value of prophesy over speaking in tongues. He explains that while speaking in tongues can be a personal prayer language, prophesy is more beneficial for the edification of the church. Prophesy allows for the sharing of a message from God that can be understood by all, while speaking in tongues requires interpretation. Paul urges the Corinthians to prioritize prophesy over tongues, as it is more useful for building up the church.

In the second section, Paul emphasizes the importance of orderly worship. He instructs the Corinthians to conduct their services in a way that is understandable and edifying for all members. He encourages them to limit the number of people speaking in tongues, and to ensure that everything is done in a way that is decent and in order.

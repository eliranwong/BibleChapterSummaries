## Summary

Titus 3 is a chapter in the New Testament that is believed to have been written by the apostle Paul to Titus, a young pastor whom he had left in Crete to oversee the church. The chapter is a call to believers to live in a manner that is pleasing to God and to be obedient to those in positions of authority.

Submission to Authorities (verses 1-2)
The chapter begins with a reminder to believers to be subject to rulers and authorities, to obey them, and to be ready for every good work. This is an important message for the early Christian community, who were living in a time when the Roman Empire was in power. Paul is urging them to live in a way that is respectful and obedient to those who are in positions of authority, and to be ready to do good works whenever they are called upon.

A Reminder of their Past and God's Mercy (verses 3-7)
In verses 3-7, Paul reminds the believers of their past life before they became followers of Christ. He tells them that they were once foolish, disobedient, and enslaved to various passions and pleasures. However, God's mercy and love saved them through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit. The passage emphasizes the transformative power of God's grace and the importance of living a life that reflects this change.

Encouragement in Good Works (verse 8)
Verse 8 encourages believers to be careful to devote themselves to good works, as they are both profitable and useful for people. It is important to note that these good works are not done to earn salvation, but rather as a response to God's love and grace.

Dealing with Divisive People (verse 9)
Verse 9 warns against foolish controversies and genealogies, which only serve to cause division among believers. Instead, the chapter encourages believers to avoid such arguments and to focus on living a peaceful and productive life.

Guidance for Titus and Other Leaders (verses 12-13)
Verses 12-13 provide guidance for Titus and other leaders in the church. Paul instructs Titus to send Artemas or Tychicus to him and to come to him himself, as he plans to spend the winter in Nicopolis. This passage emphasizes the importance of communication and collaboration among church leaders.

Exhortation to Good Works and Greetings (verse 14)
The chapter ends with an exhortation to believers to devote themselves to good works in order to meet the needs of others. Paul also sends greetings to the believers in Crete, encouraging them to continue to live in a manner that is pleasing to God.

In summary, Titus 3 is a chapter that emphasizes the importance of living a life that is pleasing to God and obedient to those in positions of authority. It also emphasizes the transformative power of God's grace and the importance of doing good works. The chapter provides guidance for church leaders and warns against division and foolish controversies. The overall message is one of unity, obedience, and devotion to God.

## Summary

Revelation 2 is a chapter in the book of Revelation that contains messages from Jesus to the seven churches in Asia. This chapter gives a glimpse into the spiritual state of these churches and offers guidance and encouragement from Jesus.

Structure:
The chapter is structured into four main sections, each addressing a specific church in Asia: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, and Thyatira. Each section begins with the phrase "To the angel of the church in [name of city] write."

Key verses:
- Revelation 2:2-3 "I know your works, your labor, your patience, and that you cannot bear those who are evil. And you have tested those who say they are apostles and are not, and have found them liars; and you have persevered and have patience, and have labored for My name's sake and have not become weary."
- Revelation 2:9 "I know your works, tribulation, and poverty (but you are rich); and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan."
- Revelation 2:13 "I know your works, and where you dwell, where Satan's throne is. And you hold fast to My name, and did not deny My faith even in the days in which Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells."
- Revelation 2:19 "I know your works, love, service, faith, and your patience; and as for your works, the last are more than the first."

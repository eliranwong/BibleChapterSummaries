## Summary

Revelation 21 is the culmination of the book of Revelation and describes the ultimate fulfillment of God's plan for humanity. The chapter begins with John's vision of a new heaven and a new earth, indicating that the current heaven and earth have passed away, and there is no more sea.

The first section of the chapter, verses 1-8, focuses on the New Jerusalem, which is the holy city of God. It is described as a place where God dwells with his people and where there is no more death, mourning, crying, or pain. God himself will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.

In verse 9, John is taken to a high mountain to see the New Jerusalem, and in the second section of the chapter, verses 9-27, he describes what he sees. The city is described as having the glory of God, and it is as brilliant as a precious jewel, like jasper, clear as crystal. The city is also surrounded by a great, high wall with 12 gates, and each gate is made of one pearl.

The city has 12 foundations, and on them are the names of the 12 apostles of the Lamb. The angel who showed John the city measured it, and it was a perfect cube, its length, width, and height all being 12,000 stadia (about 1,400 miles).

In verses 22-27, John describes how the city has no temple because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. The city has no need for the sun or the moon because the glory of God illuminates it, and the Lamb is its lamp. The gates of the city will never be shut because there is no night there, and nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful.

The theme of the chapter is the fulfillment of God's promise to dwell with his people and bring them everlasting joy and peace. The New Jerusalem represents the ultimate fulfillment of this promise, where God and his people will live together in perfect harmony and love.

To understand the significance of this chapter, it is essential to consider the historical and cultural context of the book of Revelation. The book was written during a time of intense persecution of Christians under the Roman Empire. The message of the book was intended to encourage and comfort believers who were suffering for their faith and to remind them that God is sovereign over all things and will ultimately triumph over evil.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter in various ways, with some seeing it as a literal description of the new heaven and earth, and others viewing it as symbolic language representing the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises to his people.

One of the popular interpretations of this chapter is the controversy surrounding the Millennium, a thousand-year reign of Christ on earth mentioned in chapter 20. Some interpret the chapter as meaning a literal thousand-year reign, while others see it as a symbolic representation of Christ's reign over all things.

Revelation 21 relates to other chapters in the Bible, particularly the prophetic books of Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah, which also describe the coming of the new heaven and earth and the restoration of all things.

The main lesson of this chapter is that God is faithful to his promises, and he will bring about a new heaven and earth where there will be no more pain, suffering, or death. As believers, we can look forward to this ultimate fulfillment of our hope and trust in God's perfect plan for our lives.

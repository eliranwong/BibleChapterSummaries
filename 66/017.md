From verse 1 - The Vision of the Scarlet Woman and the Scarlet Beast

## Summary

Revelation 17 is a chapter that gives an account of a vision that was shown to John by one of the seven angels with the seven bowls. The vision is of a great prostitute who sits on many waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and who is drunk with the blood of the saints and the martyrs of Jesus Christ.

The chapter is structured into three main parts. The first part, beginning with verse one, describes the vision of the Scarlet Woman and the Scarlet Beast. The second part, from verse seven to fourteen, describes the explanation of the vision of the Scarlet Beast and the ten horns. The third and last part, from verse fifteen to the end of the chapter, describes the interpretation of the vision.

In the first part of the chapter, John is shown a vision of a great prostitute who sits on many waters. The waters represent people, multitudes, nations, and tongues. The woman is described as wearing purple and scarlet, adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls, and holding a golden cup full of abominations and the filth of her fornication. On her forehead, she has a name written: "Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and Abominations of the Earth."

The Scarlet Beast, with whom the woman is riding, has seven heads and ten horns, and is covered with blasphemous names. The beast is described as having been, is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction. The seven heads of the beast represent seven mountains and seven kings, and the ten horns represent ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who will receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.

In the second part of the chapter, the angel explains to John the meaning of the vision. The woman represents a great city that reigns over the kings of the earth. The Scarlet Beast, with its seven heads and ten horns, represents the beast that was, is not, and yet will come. The seven heads represent seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, and one is yet to come. The ten horns represent ten kings who will receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.

In the third part of the chapter, the angel interprets the vision for John. The great prostitute represents a religious system that has corrupted itself with the world and has led many people astray. The Scarlet Beast represents the antichrist, who will rise up out of the abyss and wage war against the Lamb. The seven heads of the beast represent seven kingdoms or empires that have persecuted God's people throughout history. The ten horns represent ten kings who will give their power and authority to the beast.

The main themes or messages of the chapter include the corruption of religious systems, the rise of the antichrist, and the persecution of God's people. The chapter also teaches that God will judge the great prostitute and the Scarlet Beast, and that the Lamb will triumph over them.

To fully understand the chapter, it is important to consider its historical and cultural context. The book of Revelation was written during a time of intense persecution of Christians by the Roman Empire. The symbols and language used in the chapter reflect the political and religious context of the time.

The chapter has been interpreted in various ways by theologians, scholars, and religious leaders. Some see the great prostitute and the Scarlet Beast as representing specific historical figures or empires, while others interpret them as symbolizing spiritual forces of evil. There is also debate about the identity of the seven heads and the ten horns.

One popular interpretation of the chapter is that the great prostitute represents the Roman Catholic Church and the Scarlet Beast represents the antichrist or a one-world government. However, this interpretation is controversial and not widely accepted by scholars.

Revelation 17 is closely related to other chapters and themes in the Bible, particularly the book of Daniel and the prophecies of the end times. The chapter emphasizes the importance of remaining faithful to God in the face of persecution and corruption and trusting in his ultimate victory over evil.

In conclusion, Revelation 17 is a complex chapter that presents a vision of a great prostitute, the Scarlet Beast, and the judgment that will come upon them. It teaches important lessons about the corruption of religious systems, the rise of the antichrist, and the persecution of God's people. To fully understand the chapter, it is important to consider its historical and cultural context, as well as the interpretations of scholars and religious leaders.

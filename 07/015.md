## Summary

Judges 15 is a chapter in the book of Judges, which describes the period of time when the Israelites were ruled by a series of judges, chosen by God to lead them. This chapter specifically focuses on the life and actions of Samson, one of the most famous and controversial judges in the Bible.

Overview of the chapter:
The chapter begins with Samson visiting his wife during the wheat harvest, only to be denied entry by her father. In response, Samson captures 300 foxes, ties them together in pairs with torches between them, and sets them loose in the Philistines' fields, destroying their crops. The Philistines retaliate by burning Samson's wife and father-in-law to death, causing Samson to vow revenge. He attacks the Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey, killing many of them. He then becomes thirsty and cries out to God for water, and God miraculously provides it for him.

Structure of the verses:
The chapter is structured into two main sections. The first section, from verse 1 to 8, describes Samson's vengeance against the Philistines using foxes. The second section, from verse 9 to 20, describes Samson's capture and triumph over the Philistines using the jawbone of a donkey.

Key verses and passages:
One key passage in this chapter is verse 15, which reads, "And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put out his hand and took it, and with it he struck 1,000 men." This verse highlights Samson's incredible strength and bravery, as he defeats an army of Philistines with only a jawbone.

Interpretation by theologians, scholars, or religious leaders:
Many theologians and religious leaders interpret this chapter as a cautionary tale about the dangers of seeking revenge. Samson's desire for revenge leads to the death of his wife and father-in-law, as well as many Philistines.

Controversies or popular interpretations:
One popular interpretation of this chapter is that it teaches the importance of using whatever resources are available to achieve one's goals, even if those resources seem unconventional or unexpected. Others interpret this chapter as a warning against the dangers of anger and impulsiveness.

Relation to other chapters, books, or themes in the Bible:
This chapter is part of the book of Judges, which highlights the cycle of sin, judgment, and redemption that the Israelites experienced during this time period.

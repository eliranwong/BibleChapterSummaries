From verse 1 - Samson's marriage and riddle

## Summary

Judges 14 is a chapter in the Bible that narrates the story of Samson, one of the judges of Israel. In this chapter, Samson goes down to Timnah, a Philistine city, and sees a woman whom he desires to marry. The chapter is divided into two main sections: Samson's marriage and the riddle he poses to the Philistines.

The chapter begins with Samson going to Timnah and seeing a woman from the Philistine tribe whom he desires. He tells his parents to get her for him as his wife. Despite their initial reluctance, his parents eventually agree to his request. As they prepare for the wedding, Samson poses a riddle to the Philistines who are present at the wedding feast.

The riddle is as follows: "Out of the eater, something to eat; out of the strong, something sweet" (Judges 14:14). Samson promises to give thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes to anyone who can solve the riddle within seven days. The Philistines are unable to solve the riddle, and they threaten Samson's wife to get the answer from him.

Eventually, Samson's wife reveals the answer to the riddle to the Philistines, and they are able to solve it. Samson is furious, and he goes to the Philistines and kills thirty of them to fulfill his promise of the thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes. He then leaves his wife and returns to his parents' home.

The structure of the verses in this chapter is relatively straightforward. The chapter is divided into two main sections, and the narrative flows chronologically within each section. The first section (verses 1-9) describes Samson's marriage and the events leading up to the riddle. The second section (verses 10-20) focuses on the riddle and its aftermath.

The key verses in this chapter are Judges 14:14-18, which describe the riddle that Samson poses to the Philistines and their attempts to solve it. These verses reveal Samson's intelligence and wit, as well as the Philistines' desire to outsmart him.

The main themes of this chapter include marriage, loyalty, and revenge. Samson's desire for a Philistine woman shows the tension between the Israelites and the Philistines, while his anger and violence towards the Philistines after they solve his riddle demonstrate his loyalty to his people. The chapter also highlights the consequences of breaking promises and the importance of keeping one's word.

To understand this chapter, it is important to have some knowledge of the historical and cultural context of the time. The period of the judges was marked by cycles of sin, punishment, and deliverance for the Israelites. The Philistines were a powerful and oppressive tribe who often clashed with the Israelites.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter in different ways. Some see Samson's marriage to a Philistine woman as a symbol of Israel's unfaithfulness to God, while others view it as a sign of Samson's weakness and lack of judgment. The riddle has been interpreted as a test of intelligence, a metaphor for Samson's strength, and a demonstration of God's power.

There are no significant controversies related to this chapter, although some may question the morality of Samson's violent actions towards the Philistines.

Judges 14 is closely related to other chapters in the book of Judges, which focuses on the judges who served as leaders and deliverers of the Israelites during this period. The chapter also foreshadows the conflicts between Samson and the Philistines that will continue throughout his story.

The lessons and morals that can be taken from this chapter include the importance of keeping one's promises, the dangers of anger and violence, and the consequences of making hasty decisions. The chapter also highlights the tension between loyalty to one's people and personal desires.

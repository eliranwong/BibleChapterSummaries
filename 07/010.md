## Summary

Judges 10 is a chapter in the Old Testament that describes the leadership of Tola and Jair before the Israelites' oppression by the Ammonites. The chapter is divided into three parts, each detailing a different period in Israel's history.

1. Rule of Tola (verses 1-2)
The chapter begins by introducing Tola, a judge who arose after Abimelech to save Israel. Tola was a man from the tribe of Issachar who lived in Shamir, in the mountain of Ephraim. The text does not provide much information about Tola's leadership, except that he judged Israel for 23 years.

2. Rule of Jair (verses 3-5)
The second section of the chapter describes the leadership of Jair, a man from the tribe of Manasseh. He judged Israel for 22 years and had 30 sons who rode on 30 donkeys and controlled 30 cities in the land of Gilead. The text highlights Jair's wealth and prominence, but does not provide much detail about his leadership.

3. Israel's oppression by Ammon (verses 6-18)
The third and longest section of the chapter describes Israel's oppression by the Ammonites. The text explains that the Israelites had turned away from God and worshipped other gods, so God allowed the Ammonites to oppress them for 18 years. The Israelites cried out to God for help, and God responded by reminding them of their unfaithfulness and telling them to cry out to the gods they had worshipped. 

The Israelites then repented and put away their foreign gods. They gathered together and asked God to deliver them from the Ammonites. The text says that God became angry with Israel but still had compassion on them. He raised up Jephthah, a Gileadite, to deliver them from the Ammonites.

Jephthah first tried to negotiate with the Ammonites, but they refused his terms. He then went to battle against them and defeated them. The text notes that Jephthah made a foolish vow to God before the battle, promising to sacrifice the first thing that came out of his house if he was victorious. When he returned home, his daughter came out to greet him, and he was distraught because he had to fulfill his vow to God.

The main themes of the chapter are the consequences of unfaithfulness to God and the importance of repentance. The chapter also highlights the importance of leadership and the role of judges in Israel's history. 

To fully understand the chapter, it is important to consider its historical and cultural context. The period of the judges was a time of instability and conflict in Israel's history, characterized by cycles of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. The Ammonites were one of the neighboring nations that frequently threatened Israel's security.

There are different interpretations of the chapter's message and significance. Some scholars see Jephthah's vow and his daughter's sacrifice as a warning against making rash and foolish vows to God. Others see it as a critique of the patriarchal culture of the time and the tragic consequences of treating women as property. 

The chapter is also connected to other themes and passages in the Bible, such as the importance of obedience to God's commands, the role of judges and prophets in Israel's history, and the concept of sacrifice and redemption.

Overall, Judges 10 is a complex chapter that raises important questions about faithfulness, leadership, and the consequences of sin and repentance. It invites readers to reflect on their own relationship with God and their responsibility to serve and lead others in accordance with God's will.

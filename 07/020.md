From verse 1 - Israel's response and Benjamin's defeat

## Summary

Judges 20 is a continuation of the story of the Levite's concubine in Judges 19. The chapter begins with all the tribes of Israel coming together as one man to seek justice for the horrific crime committed against the Levite's concubine by the men of Gibeah, who were Benjamites. The chapter is divided into two parts: the first part describes Israel's response to the crime and Benjamin's defeat, and the second part describes Benjamin's eventual victory and the aftermath of the battle.

The first part of the chapter is structured in a chronological manner. The Israelites gather at Mizpah to decide how to deal with the men of Gibeah, and they send messengers throughout the tribe of Benjamin to demand that the guilty men be handed over for punishment. However, the Benjamites refuse to comply, and instead, they gather together to defend their fellow tribesmen. This leads to a brutal battle between the Israelites and the Benjamites, with the Israelites initially suffering heavy losses.

One of the key verses in this chapter is Judges 20:16, which states, "Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred chosen men who were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss." This verse highlights the resourcefulness and determination of the Israelites in their fight against the Benjamites.

The main themes of this chapter are justice, unity, and the consequences of sin. The Israelites come together as one to seek justice for the Levite's concubine, and their unity is ultimately what leads to Benjamin's defeat. Additionally, the chapter shows the devastating consequences of sin and how it can lead to violence, destruction, and death.

To understand the context of this chapter, it's important to note that the book of Judges takes place during a time when Israel was ruled by judges, who were appointed by God to deliver His people from oppression. The events in this chapter occur after the death of Joshua, and before the establishment of a monarchy in Israel.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter in various ways. Some see it as a cautionary tale about the dangers of tribalism and the importance of unity. Others view it as a reflection of the violent and chaotic nature of the time period in which it was written.

There are some controversies related to this chapter, particularly surrounding the violence and brutality depicted in the battle between the Israelites and the Benjamites. Some have criticized the chapter for glorifying war and bloodshed, while others argue that it accurately reflects the realities of the time period.

Judges 20 is closely related to the events of Judges 19, which describe the crime committed against the Levite's concubine and the subsequent response of the tribes of Israel. The chapter also touches on themes that are prominent throughout the book of Judges, such as the importance of obedience to God and the consequences of sin.

One lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of seeking justice and standing up for what is right, even in the face of opposition and adversity. Additionally, the chapter serves as a reminder of the devastating consequences of sin and the importance of repentance and forgiveness.

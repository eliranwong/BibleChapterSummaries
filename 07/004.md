Judges 4 recounts the story of Israel's oppression by the Canaanites and the eventual victory under the leadership of Deborah and Barak. The chapter begins with the Israelites once again doing evil in the sight of the Lord, leading to their oppression by Jabin, the king of Canaan. Deborah, a prophetess and judge, summons Barak to lead the Israelite army against the Canaanites, but Barak insists on Deborah accompanying him. In the ensuing battle, the Canaanite general Sisera is defeated and killed by Jael, a woman from the Kenite tribe.

2. Structure of the verses:

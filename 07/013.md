* From verse 1 - Birth of Samson

## Summary

Judges 13 tells the story of the birth of Samson, the last of the judges of Israel. The chapter starts with the Israelites once again doing evil in the eyes of the Lord, which leads to their subjugation to the Philistines for forty years.

The Birth of Samson:
The angel of the Lord appears to a barren woman, who is the wife of Manoah, from the tribe of Dan, and tells her that she will conceive and give birth to a son. The angel instructs her to follow certain dietary restrictions during her pregnancy and to abstain from wine and strong drink. The child is to be a Nazirite from birth, which means he is set apart for God and cannot drink wine or cut his hair.

Manoah's wife tells her husband about the visitation of the angel, and he prays to God to send the angel again so that they can be instructed on how to raise the child. God hears Manoah's prayer and sends the angel again. The angel appears to Manoah and his wife and repeats the instructions and prophecy about the child. Manoah offers a sacrifice to God, and as the sacrifice is being burnt, the angel ascends to heaven in the flames.

## Summary

Jonah 2 is a chapter that describes Jonah's prayer for deliverance while inside the belly of a great fish. It is a continuation of the story of Jonah, who was called by God to preach to the people of Nineveh, but instead fled in the opposite direction. As a result, he was thrown overboard from a ship and swallowed by a giant fish. 

The chapter is structured as a prayer in which Jonah expresses his anguish and desperation, describes his situation, remembers God's temple, renounces idolatry and praises God. 

In verses 2-4, Jonah describes his anguish and the Lord's response. He says, "In my distress I called to the Lord, and He answered me. From the depths of the grave, I called for help, and You listened to my cry." 

In verses 3-6, Jonah describes his situation, saying "You hurled me into the depths, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me; all Your waves and breakers swept over me." He also acknowledges that he was near death, saying "I was banished from Your sight; yet I will look again towards Your holy temple." 

In verse 7, Jonah remembers God's temple, saying "When my life was ebbing away, I remembered You, Lord, and my prayer rose to You, to Your holy temple." 

In verse 8, Jonah renounces idolatry and praises God, saying "Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God’s love for them. But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to You. What I have vowed I will make good. I will say, ‘Salvation comes from the Lord.'" 

Finally, in verse 10, Jonah is delivered from the fish as "the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land." 

The main themes of this chapter include repentance, salvation, and faithfulness to God. Jonah's prayer for deliverance is a call to repentance and a recognition of God's power and mercy. His near-death experience and subsequent deliverance illustrate the importance of faithfulness to God and the consequences of disobedience.

In order to fully understand this chapter, it is important to consider the historical and cultural context of the story of Jonah. The book of Jonah was likely written during the reign of Jeroboam II, a time when Israel was experiencing a period of prosperity but also moral decay. The story of Jonah was likely intended as a call to repentance for the Israelites. 

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter in various ways. Some see Jonah's prayer as a model for personal prayer, while others view it as a reflection of Israel's repentance. There is also debate over whether Jonah's experience in the fish was a literal event or a metaphorical one.

Overall, Jonah 2 reminds us of the importance of repentance and faithfulness to God, even in the most desperate of circumstances. It also emphasizes the power and mercy of God, who can deliver us from even the darkest places.

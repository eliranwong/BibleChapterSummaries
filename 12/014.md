## Summary

2 Kings 14 is a chapter in the Old Testament that focuses on the reign of Amaziah of Judah and Jeroboam II of Israel. The chapter is divided into five subheadings.

Amaziah's Mixed Reign
The chapter begins by stating that Amaziah became king of Judah in the second year of Joash's reign over Israel. The first few verses describe Amaziah's reign as mixed, as he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord but not wholeheartedly. The chapter mentions that he executed those who killed his father but spared their children as the Lord commanded in the Law. However, Amaziah also worshipped the gods of Edom, which led to the downfall of his reign.

Amaziah's Victories Over Edom
The second subheading describes Amaziah's military conquests over Edom. He assembled his army and defeated the Edomites, killing ten thousand of them in battle. He also captured the city of Sela and renamed it Joktheel. Amaziah's victories over Edom are a significant event in the chapter as they cemented his reputation as a strong and successful king.

Amaziah's Failed Challenge to Jehoash
The third subheading describes Amaziah's failed challenge to Jehoash, the king of Israel. Amaziah sent a message to Jehoash, challenging him to battle. Jehoash responded by mocking Amaziah's military might and warning him not to provoke a conflict that he could not win. Despite this, Amaziah still went to battle and was defeated. This event marked the end of Amaziah's reign as a successful king.

Amaziah's Death
The fourth subheading describes Amaziah's death. After his defeat by Jehoash, Amaziah fled to Lachish, where he was eventually assassinated. His son, Azariah, succeeded him as king of Judah.

Jeroboam's Wicked Reign and Expansion
The fifth subheading describes the reign of Jeroboam II of Israel. The chapter notes that he did evil in the eyes of the Lord but still enjoyed a long and prosperous reign. He restored Israel's borders and expanded its territory. Jeroboam's reign is significant as it marked a time of relative peace and prosperity for Israel.

In conclusion, 2 Kings 14 is a chapter that highlights the reigns of two kings, Amaziah of Judah and Jeroboam II of Israel. The chapter emphasizes the importance of wholehearted devotion to the Lord and the consequences of worshipping false gods. It also highlights the significance of military victories and the consequences of failed challenges. The chapter is a reminder of the importance of being faithful to God and the consequences of disobedience.

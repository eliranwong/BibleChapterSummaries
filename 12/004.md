## Summary

Chapter 4 of 2 Kings is a collection of four stories that highlight the power and compassion of the prophet Elisha. Each story focuses on a different miracle performed by Elisha that shows God's provision and care for His people.

The chapter begins with the story of a widow who is in debt and about to lose her two sons to her creditor. She seeks help from Elisha, who asks her what she has in her house. She tells him that she only has a jar of oil, and he instructs her to borrow as many jars as possible from her neighbors. She obediently follows his instructions, and the oil miraculously multiplies until she has enough to sell and pay off her debts. This story shows that God can provide for His people in unexpected ways, even in times of great need.

The second story introduces us to a wealthy woman from the town of Shunem who recognizes Elisha as a holy man of God and offers him hospitality. Elisha is grateful and asks his servant to ask her what he can do for her. She tells him that she has no children and her husband is old. Elisha then prophesies that she will have a son within a year. The woman is skeptical but she becomes pregnant and has a son just as Elisha had promised. Tragically, the boy dies suddenly when he is a young child. The woman then seeks out Elisha and he prays for the boy's life to be restored. God hears his prayer and the boy is resurrected. This story emphasizes the power of faith and the importance of showing hospitality to God's servants.

The third story takes place during a famine, and Elisha is staying in the city of Gilgal. He instructs his servant to make a stew for the prophets, but unknowingly, the servant gathers poisonous gourds and adds them to the stew. When the prophets eat the stew, they become sick. Elisha then miraculously heals them by adding flour to the stew. This story shows that God can protect His people from harm, even in times of scarcity.

The final story is about a man who brings Elisha twenty loaves of bread and some grain as an offering. Elisha instructs him to distribute the food to one hundred men, and miraculously, there is enough food for all of them to eat and be satisfied. This story illustrates God's abundance and generosity.

Overall, this chapter highlights the power and compassion of God as demonstrated through the prophet Elisha. The stories emphasize the importance of faith, hospitality, obedience, and trust in God's provision.

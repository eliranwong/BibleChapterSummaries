## Summary

2 Kings chapter 15 provides a detailed account of the kings who ruled over Israel and Judah during a period of political instability, violence, and upheaval in the region. The chapter begins with the reign of Azariah, son of Amaziah, king of Judah, in the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam, king of Israel.

Azariah's Prosperous and Offensive Reign:
Azariah, also known as Uzziah, was a righteous and prosperous king who ruled Judah for 52 years. He followed the ways of the Lord and did what was right in His eyes. Under his leadership, Judah experienced peace, prosperity, and military success. Azariah rebuilt the city of Elath and restored it to Judah. He also defeated the Philistines, the Arabians, and the Ammonites, gaining control over their territories. Azariah's success was attributed to his trust in God.

However, despite Azariah's righteous reign, his pride led to his downfall. He entered the temple of the Lord and attempted to burn incense, a task reserved for the priests. As a result, God struck him with leprosy, and he was forced to live in isolation until his death.

Zechariah's Reign and Murder:
After Azariah's death, his son Jotham took over the throne of Judah. However, in Israel, the throne was in constant turmoil. Zechariah, the son of Jeroboam, became king of Israel and ruled for only six months before being assassinated by Shallum, who usurped the throne.

Shallum's Reign and Murder:
Shallum ruled Israel for only a month before being assassinated by Menahem, who became the next king of Israel.

Menahem's Reign:
Menahem was a cruel and oppressive king who did not follow the ways of the Lord. He paid a tribute to Assyria to secure his position as king and brutally suppressed any opposition to his reign.

Pekahiah's Reign and Assassination:
After Menahem's death, his son Pekahiah became king of Israel. However, his reign was short-lived as he was assassinated by Pekah, one of his military officers.

Pekah's Reign:
Pekah ruled Israel for 20 years and was known for his wickedness and idolatry. During his reign, Assyria invaded Israel and took control of many of its territories, leading to a period of decline and devastation.

The Reign of Jotham in Judah:
The chapter concludes with the reign of Jotham, son of Azariah, who ruled Judah for 16 years. Jotham followed in his father's footsteps and did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. He rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple and fortified the walls of Jerusalem. However, despite Jotham's righteous reign, the people of Judah continued to practice idolatry.

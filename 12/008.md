## Summary

2 Kings 8 is a chapter of the Old Testament that provides an account of the prophet Elisha's interactions with various people and events. The chapter can be divided into several subheadings, each of which presents a distinct story.

Elisha and the Shunammite's Land (verses 1-6):
The chapter opens with Elisha advising the Shunammite woman, whose son he had previously brought back to life, to leave her land due to an upcoming famine. She does so and returns seven years later to find her property has been taken over by someone else. Through Elisha's intervention, she is able to reclaim her land, which was previously granted to her by the king.

Elisha and Hazael (verses 7-15):
In this section, Elisha sends his servant to anoint Hazael as the future king of Syria. When Hazael meets with Elisha, he is told that he will become king and perform terrible acts, including killing men, women, children, and infants. Hazael is disturbed by this prophecy but ultimately carries it out after becoming king.

Jehoram's Wickedness (verses 16-24):
This section describes the reign of Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, as the king of Judah. Jehoram is depicted as a wicked ruler who kills his own brothers and leads his kingdom astray. His reign is also marked by military defeats and alliances with Israel's king, Ahab.

Edom and Libnah Revolt (verse 20):
This verse briefly mentions a revolt by Edom and Libnah against Jehoram's rule.

Jehoram's Death (verses 23-24):

Ahaziah's Wicked Reign (verses 26-29):
The final section of the chapter describes Ahaziah's reign as king of Judah. Like his father, he is depicted as a wicked ruler who follows in the footsteps of the kings of Israel. His reign is cut short by Jehu, who kills him and takes the throne of both Israel and Judah.

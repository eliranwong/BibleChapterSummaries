## Summary

2 Kings 21 is a chapter that describes the reign of Manasseh, king of Judah. The chapter begins by stating that Manasseh was 12 years old when he became king and reigned for 55 years in Jerusalem. The chapter then goes on to describe the wickedness of Manasseh and how he led the people of Judah astray.

The verses in this chapter are structured in a chronological order, describing Manasseh’s reign from the beginning to the end. The chapter is divided into three sections: Manasseh’s reign (verses 1-18), his death and succession (verses 19-26), and Amon’s reign (verses 27-36).

There are several key verses in this chapter, including verse 3 which states, “For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; he raised up altars for Baal, and made a wooden image, as Ahab king of Israel had done; and he worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.” This verse highlights the wickedness of Manasseh and his disregard for God’s commandments. Another key verse is verse 16, which states, “Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides his sin by which he made Judah sin, in doing evil in the sight of the Lord.”

The significant characters in this chapter are Manasseh, the king of Judah, and his son Amon, who succeeded him as king. The events described in this chapter include Manasseh’s idolatry, his building of altars to false gods, and his shedding of innocent blood. The symbols in this chapter include the high places and altars that Manasseh built, which represent his disobedience to God.

The main themes of this chapter are the consequences of disobedience to God, the importance of following God’s commandments, and the danger of idolatry. The chapter also highlights the importance of repentance and turning back to God, as Manasseh eventually did in his later years.

The historical context of this chapter is important to understand, as it takes place during a period of political instability and religious upheaval in Judah. The Assyrian Empire was expanding its power in the region, and many people in Judah were turning away from God and embracing idolatry.

Theologians, scholars, and religious leaders have interpreted this chapter as a warning against the dangers of idolatry and the importance of repentance. Many have also pointed to Manasseh’s eventual repentance as an example of God’s mercy and forgiveness.

There are some controversies surrounding this chapter, particularly regarding the extent of Manasseh’s wickedness and whether his later repentance was genuine. Some scholars believe that the description of Manasseh’s wickedness may have been exaggerated in order to emphasize the importance of following God’s commandments.

This chapter relates to other themes in the Bible, including the importance of obedience to God and the consequences of sin. It also foreshadows the Babylonian exile, which would later occur as a result of Judah’s disobedience to God.

The lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of following God’s commandments and avoiding idolatry. It also highlights the power of repentance and the mercy of God.

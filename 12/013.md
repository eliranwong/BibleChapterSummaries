## Summary

2 Kings 13 is a chapter primarily focused on the reign of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, over the northern kingdom of Israel. The chapter is divided into three distinct sections: Jehoash's Mixed Reign, The Arrows of Victory, and Elisha's Death and Israel's Victories.

Jehoash's Mixed Reign (verses 10-13) begins by highlighting the struggles of the Israelites under Jehoash's rule. The king of Syria, Hazael, had been oppressing the Israelites for years, and Jehoash was unable to free his people from this oppression. However, the chapter notes that Jehoash did seek the help of Elisha, a well-known prophet of God, and that Elisha was able to provide some guidance and assistance to the king.

The Arrows of Victory (verses 14-19) is a peculiar account of Jehoash's visit to Elisha on his deathbed. Elisha instructed Jehoash to take a bow and arrows and shoot them out the east window of the room. Elisha then placed his hands on the king's hands, symbolizing the power of God. Jehoash shot three arrows and Elisha declared that the king would have victory over Syria only three times. Jehoash was upset that Elisha did not ask him to shoot more arrows, and the prophet rebuked him, stating that he should have struck the ground with the arrows because then he would have had complete victory over Syria.

Elisha's Death and Israel's Victories (verses 20-25) ends the chapter with the death of Elisha and several victories of the Israelites over the Syrians. As Elisha was being buried, a group of men saw a raiding party of Moabites and threw the dead man's body into Elisha's tomb. When the body touched Elisha's bones, the man came to life, symbolizing the power and influence of Elisha's faith in God even after his death. After this miraculous event, the Israelites were able to defeat the Moabites and the Syrians, further proving the power and favor of God.

Overall, 2 Kings 13 highlights the struggles and victories of the Israelites under the reign of Jehoash, as well as the power and influence of Elisha as a prophet of God.

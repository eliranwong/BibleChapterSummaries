## Summary

2 Kings 6 is a chapter that contains three separate stories involving the prophet Elisha. These stories demonstrate the power and authority that Elisha held in his ministry, as well as his faithfulness to God.

Elisha and the Floating Axe Head (verses 1-7):
The chapter begins with the sons of the prophets coming to Elisha and telling him that the place where they are living is too small for them. Elisha tells them to go to the Jordan River and gather wood to build a new place to live. As one of the men is cutting down a tree, the iron axe head he is using falls into the water. The man cries out to Elisha, who throws a stick into the water and makes the axe head float to the surface. This miracle demonstrates Elisha's power and authority as a prophet of God, as well as God's willingness to help those who call on Him.

Elisha and the Aramean War (verses 8-23):
The next story in the chapter involves the ongoing war between Israel and Aram. Elisha is able to give the king of Israel advanced warning about the Aramean army's movements, allowing Israel to avoid ambushes and win key battles. When the Aramean king learns that Elisha is the one giving away his plans, he sends a large force to capture Elisha. However, Elisha prays to God and asks Him to open the eyes of his servant, who sees that the hills around them are filled with the horses and chariots of fire that God has sent to protect them. The Aramean army is then struck with blindness, allowing Elisha to lead them into the city of Samaria and capture them. This story demonstrates Elisha's faithfulness to God and the power of prayer.

Elisha and the Siege of Samaria (verses 24-33):
The final story in the chapter takes place during a time of famine in Samaria. The city is under siege by the Arameans, and food is scarce. As the situation becomes more desperate, two women come to the king with a terrible story. They had agreed to eat their own children, and one had already been eaten. The king tears his clothes in grief and anger, and Elisha prophesies that the next day food will be so plentiful that it will be sold for a low price. This prophecy comes true when the Aramean army suddenly flees, leaving behind their supplies. The people rush out to gather the food and the prophecy is fulfilled. This story shows God's provision for His people even in the midst of difficult circumstances.

In summary, 2 Kings 6 is a chapter that highlights the power and authority of Elisha as a prophet of God. The stories demonstrate God's willingness to help those who call on Him, and Elisha's faithfulness to God. The chapter also emphasizes the importance of prayer and demonstrates God's provision for His people even in difficult times. Overall, the chapter serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and His power to work miracles in the lives of those who trust in Him.

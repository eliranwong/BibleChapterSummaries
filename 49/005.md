## Summary

Ephesians 5 is a chapter that focuses on how Christians should live their lives in accordance with God's will. The chapter is divided into four main sections: walking in love, walking as children of light, walking in wisdom, and wives and husbands. 

In the first section, Paul urges believers to imitate God by walking in love. He reminds them that Christ loved them and gave himself up for them as a sacrifice, and they should also love one another sacrificially. Paul encourages believers to avoid sexual immorality, impurity, and greed, and to instead give thanks to God. He warns that those who practice such things have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.

The second section deals with walking as children of light. Paul reminds believers that they were once in darkness, but now they are in the light of the Lord. He urges them to live as children of light, bearing fruit that pleases the Lord. He encourages them to expose the deeds of darkness and to have nothing to do with them. He reminds them that everything exposed by the light becomes visible, and that it is the Lord who makes everything visible.

In the third section, Paul urges believers to walk in wisdom, making the most of every opportunity because the days are evil. He encourages them not to be foolish, but to understand what the Lord's will is. He reminds them to be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, and giving thanks to God for everything.

The fourth and final section deals with the relationship between wives and husbands. Paul urges wives to submit to their husbands as they do to the Lord, and for husbands to love their wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. He reminds husbands that they are to love their wives as their own bodies, and that the two become one flesh. He concludes by saying that this is a profound mystery, but that it refers to Christ and the church.

In terms of structure, the chapter is divided into sections as mentioned above. Each section deals with a specific aspect of Christian living and contains instructions and admonitions for believers. There are several key verses in the chapter, including verse 1 which sets the tone for the entire chapter, and verse 22 which has been the subject of much debate and controversy regarding the relationship between wives and husbands.

The themes of the chapter include love, light, wisdom, and the relationship between husbands and wives. Paul emphasizes the importance of living a life that is pleasing to God and avoiding sinful behavior. He also highlights the significance of the relationship between Christ and the church, using it as a model for the relationship between husbands and wives.

The historical and cultural context of the chapter is important to understand. Paul was writing to the Ephesian church, which was located in a city known for its immorality and pagan worship. The believers in Ephesus were living in a culture that was hostile to Christianity, and Paul's instructions would have been relevant to their situation.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter in various ways. Some have focused on the relationship between husbands and wives, while others have emphasized the importance of living a life that is pleasing to God. There have been debates regarding the meaning of submission and love in the context of marriage, and how these concepts should be applied in modern times.

In terms of lessons and morals, the chapter emphasizes the importance of living a life that is pleasing to God and avoiding sinful behavior. It also highlights the significance of the relationship between Christ and the church, and the model it provides for the relationship between husbands and wives. The chapter encourages believers to walk in love, light, and wisdom, and to make the most of every opportunity to serve the Lord.

## Summary

Ephesians 3 is a chapter where Paul reveals the mystery of Christ to the Gentiles and explains his role as a minister of the Gospel to them. The chapter is divided into three distinct subheadings: The Mystery Revealed to Paul, Paul's Role as a Minister to the Gentiles, and Paul's Prayer for Spiritual Growth and Unity.

In the first subheading, Paul begins by stating that he is a prisoner of Christ for the sake of the Gentiles. He then goes on to explain that this mystery was not made known to previous generations but has now been revealed to the apostles and prophets by the Spirit. The mystery is that Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the Gospel.

In the second subheading, Paul explains his role as a minister to the Gentiles. He states that he was made a minister of the Gospel by the grace of God and was given the task of preaching to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ. He also reveals that his mission was to bring to light what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things.

In the third subheading, Paul offers a prayer for spiritual growth and unity. He prays that Christ may dwell in the hearts of the believers and that they may be rooted and grounded in love. He also prays that they may have the strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge.

The key verse of this chapter is Ephesians 3:6, which states, "This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel."

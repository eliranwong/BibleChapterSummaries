## Summary

Luke Chapter 9 starts with Jesus calling his twelve disciples together and giving them the power and authority to heal the sick and cast out demons. This chapter is a continuation of Jesus' ministry on earth, where he not only teaches, but also performs miracles and signs to show his authority as the Son of God.

Sending out the Twelve:
In verses 1-6, Jesus sends out his twelve disciples in pairs to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. He instructs them to take nothing with them except a staff and to rely on the hospitality of those they visit. The disciples go out and do as they were instructed, healing and preaching the gospel.

Herod's Fears about Jesus:
In verses 7-9, Herod hears about Jesus' miracles and wonders if he is John the Baptist raised from the dead. This shows the impact of Jesus' ministry and how it was causing a stir among the people.

Feeding the Five Thousand:
In verses 10-17, Jesus performs the miracle of feeding the five thousand with just five loaves of bread and two fish. This miracle shows Jesus' power over nature and his compassion for the people.

Peter's Confession and Jesus' Prediction of Suffering:
In verses 18-27, Jesus asks his disciples who they think he is. Peter confesses that he is the Christ of God. Jesus then predicts his own suffering and death, which Peter and the other disciples do not fully understand at the time.

Transfiguration of Jesus:
In verses 28-36, Jesus takes Peter, James, and John up a mountain to pray. While there, Jesus' appearance is transfigured, and he talks with Moses and Elijah. This event confirms Jesus' divinity and foreshadows his death and resurrection.

Healing of a Demon-Possessed Boy:
In verses 37-43, Jesus heals a boy possessed by a demon that the disciples were unable to cast out. This miracle shows Jesus' power over evil spirits and his compassion for those who are suffering.

Jesus Predicts his Death for the Second Time:
In verses 44-45, Jesus predicts his own death and resurrection for the second time. He tells his disciples that he will be betrayed, killed, and raised from the dead on the third day.

Jesus Teaches True Greatness:
In verses 46-50, Jesus teaches his disciples about true greatness. He tells them that whoever wants to be the greatest must be the least and the servant of all. This lesson challenges our worldly understanding of greatness and encourages humility.

Rejection in a Samaritan Village:
In verses 51-56, Jesus and his disciples are rejected by a Samaritan village because they are on their way to Jerusalem. This event shows the hostility between Jews and Samaritans and the rejection that Jesus faced during his ministry.

The Cost of Discipleship:
In verses 57-62, Jesus teaches about the cost of following him. He tells those who want to follow him that they must be willing to give up everything, including family and possessions. This lesson emphasizes the importance of counting the cost before committing to following Jesus.

In summary, Luke Chapter 9 is a significant chapter in the Bible as it provides insights into Jesus' teachings and miracles during his ministry on earth. This chapter emphasizes Jesus' authority and power over nature, sickness, and evil spirits. It also highlights the importance of humility, sacrifice, and counting the cost of discipleship. The chapter includes significant events such as the Transfiguration of Jesus, feeding the five thousand, and the healing of a demon-possessed boy. These events demonstrate Jesus' compassion and love for people, and his divinity as the Son of God.

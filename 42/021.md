## Summary

Luke 21 is a chapter that focuses on the teachings of Jesus concerning the end times. The chapter can be divided into two sections, the first being the story of the widow's offering in verses 1-4, and the second being the Olivet Discourse in verses 5-38.

The story of the widow's offering begins with Jesus observing the rich depositing their gifts into the temple treasury. Then, a poor widow comes and puts in two small copper coins, which Jesus says is worth more than all the others because she gave out of her poverty, while the others gave out of their abundance. This story highlights the importance of giving sacrificially and with a pure heart, rather than giving for show or recognition.

The Olivet Discourse is Jesus' teaching about the end times, specifically the destruction of Jerusalem and the signs of His second coming. In verses 5-19, Jesus warns His disciples about false messiahs and the coming of wars, earthquakes, and famines. He also tells them that they will face persecution for their faith, but they should not be afraid because He will give them the words to speak. In verses 20-28, Jesus prophesies the destruction of Jerusalem and the signs that will accompany it. He warns the disciples to flee when they see these signs. In verses 29-38, Jesus gives a parable about a fig tree and emphasizes the importance of being ready for His return, as no one knows the day or hour when it will happen.

The main theme of this chapter is the importance of being prepared for the end times. Jesus emphasizes the need for sacrificial giving, perseverance in the face of persecution, and being alert and ready for His return. The chapter also highlights the importance of trusting in God and not being swayed by false teachings or signs.

To fully understand the context of this chapter, it is important to know that Jesus is speaking to His disciples in the temple, shortly before His crucifixion. The destruction of Jerusalem, which Jesus prophesies in this chapter, occurred in AD 70, several decades after His death and resurrection.

Theologians and scholars interpret this chapter as a warning to the church to be prepared for the end times and to remain faithful to God, even in the face of persecution. The parable of the fig tree is often seen as a symbol of Israel, and the destruction of Jerusalem is seen as a fulfillment of Jesus' prophecies about the end times.

There are some controversies related to this chapter, particularly regarding the interpretation of the Olivet Discourse. Some scholars believe that Jesus was speaking about events that have already occurred, while others believe that He was prophesying events that are yet to come.

This chapter is closely related to other passages in the Bible that discuss the end times, such as Matthew 24 and Mark 13. It also emphasizes the importance of sacrificial giving, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible.

The main lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of being prepared for the end times and remaining faithful to God, even in the face of persecution. It also emphasizes the value of sacrificial giving and trusting in God's provision.

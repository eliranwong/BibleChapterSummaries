## Summary

Luke 6 is a chapter in the New Testament which begins with a story of Jesus and his disciples walking through a grainfield on the Sabbath. The Pharisees, a group of religious leaders, confront Jesus and criticize him for allowing his disciples to break the Sabbath law by picking and eating grain. Jesus defends his disciples by reminding the Pharisees that King David and his men ate the bread that was reserved for priests and that the Sabbath was made for man, not vice versa. This encounter highlights Jesus' authority and his willingness to challenge the religious establishment.

The chapter then moves on to the selection of the twelve apostles. Jesus spends the night in prayer and then chooses twelve men to be his closest followers and to carry on his teachings after he is gone. This event emphasizes the importance of prayer and discernment in making significant decisions and also establishes the foundation for the church.

The third section of the chapter is the Sermon on the Plain. This is a parallel to the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5-7, but with some significant differences. The Sermon on the Plain is more concise and straightforward and focuses on practical teachings for everyday life. Jesus begins by pronouncing blessings on the poor, hungry, and those who weep, and woes on the rich, full, and those who laugh. He encourages his followers to love their enemies, to do good to those who hate them, and to turn the other cheek when someone strikes them. He also teaches about judging others, forgiveness, and the importance of bearing good fruit. Overall, the Sermon on the Plain emphasizes the importance of humility, compassion, and love.

One significant character in this chapter is Jesus, who is the central figure in the story and the one who is teaching and demonstrating his authority. The Pharisees are also important characters as they represent the religious establishment and are challenging Jesus' teachings. The twelve apostles are introduced in this chapter and become significant figures in the rest of the New Testament.

The main themes of this chapter include Jesus' authority, the importance of prayer and discernment, and practical teachings for everyday life. The chapter also emphasizes the importance of humility, compassion, and love. Understanding the historical and cultural context is crucial to interpreting this chapter. In Jesus' time, the Sabbath was a significant part of Jewish religious practice, and breaking the Sabbath law was a serious offense. The Sermon on the Plain also reflects the social and economic realities of the time, with the poor and hungry being a significant part of the population.

Theologians, scholars, and religious leaders have interpreted this chapter in various ways. Some see it as a demonstration of Jesus' authority over the religious establishment, while others emphasize the practical teachings for everyday life. The Sermon on the Plain has been compared and contrasted with the Sermon on the Mount, and scholars have debated the significance of the differences between the two.

One lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of following Jesus' teachings, even when they challenge established religious practices or social norms. The chapter also emphasizes the importance of prayer, discernment, and compassion in making significant decisions and living a meaningful life.

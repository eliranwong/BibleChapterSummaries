## Summary

John 17 is a chapter that records the prayer that Jesus offered to God the Father just before his arrest and crucifixion. The chapter can be divided into three sections: Jesus praying for himself, Jesus praying for his disciples, and Jesus praying for all believers.

In the first section, Jesus prays for himself. He acknowledges that his time on earth is coming to an end and asks God to glorify him so that he may glorify God in return. Jesus also acknowledges that he has completed the work that God had given him to do on earth.

In the second section, Jesus prays for his disciples. He prays for their protection and for their unity. Jesus also prays that his disciples may have joy and that they may be sanctified in the truth. Jesus acknowledges that the disciples are not of the world, just as he is not of the world.

In the final section, Jesus prays for all believers. He prays that all believers may be one, just as he and the Father are one. Jesus also prays that believers may be filled with his joy and that they may be protected from the evil one. Jesus acknowledges that believers are in the world but not of the world.

The structure of the chapter is organized around Jesus' prayer, with each section focusing on a different aspect of the prayer. The chapter begins with Jesus addressing God the Father and then moves into the three sections of the prayer.

There are several key verses in this chapter. One of the most well-known verses is John 17:3, where Jesus defines eternal life as knowing God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent. Another key verse is John 17:11, where Jesus prays for his disciples to be protected and to be one, just as he and the Father are one.

The main themes of the chapter include unity, protection, joy, sanctification, and eternal life. Jesus prays for his disciples and all believers to be protected from the evil one and to be filled with his joy. Jesus also prays for believers to be sanctified in the truth and to have eternal life through knowing God and Jesus Christ.

To understand the context of this prayer, it is important to recognize that Jesus is about to be arrested and crucified. He knows that his time on earth is coming to an end and that his disciples will face persecution and hardship. Jesus' prayer is a plea for God's protection and guidance for his disciples and for all believers.

Scholars and religious leaders have interpreted this chapter in various ways. Some have focused on the unity of believers and the importance of coming together as a community. Others have emphasized the protection and guidance that God provides for believers. Still, others have focused on the idea of eternal life and what it means to know God and Jesus Christ.

One controversy related to this chapter is the question of whether Jesus' prayer was answered. Some argue that since believers have not yet achieved complete unity and protection, Jesus' prayer was not answered. Others argue that Jesus' prayer was answered in a spiritual sense, even if it has not yet been fully realized in the physical world.

John 17 relates to other themes in the Bible, including the idea of obedience to God, the importance of prayer, and the concept of eternal life. Jesus' prayer in this chapter is a model for believers to follow in their own prayer lives.

One moral lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of unity and protection for believers. Jesus' prayer emphasizes the need for believers to come together and support one another, even in the face of persecution and hardship. Another lesson is the importance of knowing God and Jesus Christ, which is the key to eternal life according to Jesus' definition in this chapter.

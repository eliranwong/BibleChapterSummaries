## Summary

John 21 is the final chapter of the Gospel of John and describes several events that occurred after Jesus' resurrection. The chapter begins with Jesus appearing to his disciples beside the Sea of Galilee. In this appearance, Jesus performs a miraculous catch of fish, which reminds the disciples of a similar event that occurred earlier in Jesus' ministry. This prompts Peter to recognize that it is Jesus who is appearing to them and he jumps into the water to swim to shore.

The second section of the chapter, starting from verse 15, focuses on Jesus and Peter. After breakfast, Jesus asks Peter three times if he loves Him, to which Peter responds affirmatively each time. This exchange is significant because it mirrors Peter's earlier denial of Jesus three times before His crucifixion. Jesus then tells Peter to "feed my lambs" and "tend my sheep," indicating that Peter has a special role to play in leading and caring for Jesus' followers.

In the next section, from verse 20, Jesus and the beloved disciple are featured. The beloved disciple is present at the Sea of Galilee and is the first to recognize Jesus. This prompts Peter to ask Jesus about the beloved disciple's fate. Jesus responds by saying, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me." This statement indicates that each disciple has their own unique path to follow and that they should not compare themselves to others.

The chapter concludes with a statement about the purpose of John's Gospel. The author notes that there were many other things that Jesus did during His ministry that were not recorded in the Gospel, but that the things that were written were done so that people might believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing they may have life in His name.

Overall, John 21 emphasizes the importance of recognizing and following Jesus, as well as the unique roles that each individual has in serving Him. The chapter also highlights the power and significance of Jesus' resurrection and the impact it had on His followers. The chapter's themes of faith, leadership, and individuality are still relevant today and can provide guidance for Christians seeking to live out their faith.

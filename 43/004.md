## Summary

John Chapter 4 is a significant chapter in the Bible as it portrays Jesus as the Son of God, who has come to save all humanity. This chapter begins with Jesus learning that the Pharisees have heard that He is making and baptizing more disciples than John. In response, Jesus decides to leave Judea and travel to Galilee.

Jesus and the Woman of Samaria:
As Jesus travels to Galilee, He stops at a well in Samaria. There, He meets a Samaritan woman who has come to draw water. Jesus asks her for a drink, and the woman is surprised that a Jewish man would speak to a Samaritan woman. However, Jesus explains that He has come to offer her living water, which will satisfy her thirst forever. Through this conversation, Jesus reveals to the woman that He is the Messiah and that true worshipers will worship God in spirit and truth.

The Harvest of the Gospel:
After the woman leaves, Jesus' disciples return and are surprised to find Him talking to a Samaritan woman. Jesus tells them that His mission is to do the will of God and to bring salvation to all people. He then uses the analogy of a harvest to explain how the Gospel will spread throughout the world. Jesus explains that some will sow the seeds of the Gospel, others will water them, and still others will reap the harvest. The disciples are encouraged to be part of this process and to spread the good news of salvation.

Jesus Heals an Official's son:
The chapter concludes with Jesus healing the son of an official who had come to Him seeking help. This official had faith in Jesus' ability to heal his son and believed that Jesus was the Son of God. Jesus performs the miracle, and the official's faith is strengthened.

## Summary

John 20 is a pivotal chapter in the New Testament, as it chronicles the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the events that took place after his resurrection. This chapter is divided into five sections, each of which highlights a distinct aspect of the resurrection story.

The Empty Tomb (verses 1-10)
The chapter begins with the discovery of the empty tomb by Mary Magdalene. She arrives at the tomb early in the morning and finds that the stone has been rolled away from the entrance. She runs to tell Peter and John, who come to see for themselves. They find the linen cloths that had been wrapped around Jesus' body, but he is nowhere to be found. This sets the stage for the rest of the chapter.

Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene (verses 11-18)
After Peter and John leave the tomb, Mary stays behind, weeping. She sees two angels inside the tomb, who ask her why she is crying. She turns around and sees Jesus, but does not recognize him at first. He calls her by name, and she realizes who he is. Jesus tells her to go and tell the disciples that he is ascending to his Father and their Father, his God and their God.

Jesus Appears to His Disciples (verses 19-23)
Later that same day, the disciples are gathered together in a locked room, afraid of the Jewish leaders. Suddenly, Jesus appears among them, even though the doors are locked. He shows them his hands and his side, and they are filled with joy. Jesus then commissions them to go out and preach the gospel, and he breathes on them, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone's sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."

Jesus and Thomas (verses 24-29)
One of the disciples, Thomas, is not present when Jesus appears to the others. When they tell him that they have seen the Lord, he says he will not believe it unless he can see and touch Jesus' wounds for himself. A week later, Jesus appears again, specifically to show Thomas his wounds. Thomas confesses his faith, saying, "My Lord and my God!"

The Purpose of John's Gospel (verses 30-31)
The chapter ends with a statement of purpose for John's gospel. John writes, "Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name."

In summary, John 20 is a powerful testimony to the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the impact it had on his followers. It highlights the empty tomb, Jesus' appearance to Mary Magdalene, his commissioning of his disciples, his encounter with Thomas, and the purpose of John's gospel. The chapter serves as a reminder of the power of faith and the importance of believing in Jesus as the Son of God.

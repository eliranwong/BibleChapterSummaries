## Summary

Numbers chapter 34 is primarily about the boundaries of the promised land and the appointment of leaders to divide the land among the tribes of Israel. The chapter begins with God speaking to Moses and giving him instructions on how to divide the land among the twelve tribes of Israel. 

Boundaries of the Promised Land:
God tells Moses to instruct the Israelites to take possession of the land of Canaan and to divide it among themselves by casting lots. The borders of the land are described in detail, from the southern border of the desert of Zin to the northern border of Mount Hor. The eastern and western borders are also described. The chapter mentions several places that serve as markers for the boundaries, such as the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan River.

Leaders to Divide the Land:
God tells Moses to appoint leaders from each tribe to help divide the land among the people. These leaders are to be chosen based on their wisdom and knowledge of the land. The chapter lists the names of these leaders, one from each tribe, and Moses instructs them on how to divide the land.

One of the key verses in this chapter is verse 13, which says, "Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying: 'This is the land which you shall inherit by lot, which the Lord has commanded to give to the nine tribes and to the half-tribe.'"

# Numbers 24

## Subheadings

* From verse 1 - Balaam's Third and Fourth Oracles

## Summary

Overview:
Numbers 24 is the third and final oracle of Balaam, a pagan prophet hired by Balak, King of Moab, to curse the Israelites. However, instead of cursing them, Balaam blesses the Israelites three times. In this chapter, Balaam delivers his third and fourth oracles, both of which are blessings upon Israel.

Structure:
The chapter is structured around Balaam's two oracles. In the third oracle (verses 3-9), Balaam sees a vision of the Israelite camp and blesses them, declaring that they will be blessed by God and that their enemies will be defeated. In the fourth oracle (verses 15-24), Balaam again sees a vision of the Israelites and blesses them, saying that a great king will arise from among them and conquer their enemies.

Key Verses:
- "How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob, your dwelling places, O Israel!" (verse 5)
- "Blessed is everyone who blesses you, and cursed is everyone who curses you." (verse 9)
- "I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel." (verse 17)

- The promise of a great king arising from the Israelites (interpreted by Christians as referring to Jesus)

Historical or Cultural Context:
This chapter takes place during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after their escape from Egypt. Moab was one of the neighboring nations who feared the Israelites and sought to prevent their progress. Balaam was a well-known pagan prophet who was believed to have the power to curse people, and Balak hired him to curse the Israelites. However, God prevented Balaam from cursing the Israelites and instead caused him to bless them.

Interpretations:
Many theologians and scholars interpret Balaam's oracles as evidence of God's sovereignty over all nations and his protection of his people. The promise of a great king arising from the Israelites has been interpreted by Christians as referring to Jesus, who was born from the line of David, a descendant of Jacob.

Controversies:
One controversy surrounding this chapter is the interpretation of the star and scepter mentioned in Balaam's fourth oracle. While Christians interpret this as referring to Jesus, some Jewish scholars interpret it as referring to King David or another Jewish king.

Relation to Other Chapters, Books, or Themes in the Bible:
Balaam's oracles are referenced in other parts of the Bible, such as Micah 6:5 and 2 Peter 2:15-16. The promise of a great king arising from the Israelites is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament and is believed by Christians to be fulfilled in Jesus.

Lessons or Morals:
This chapter teaches the importance of blessing rather than cursing, as well as the power of God's protection over his people. It also emphasizes the promise of a great king arising from the Israelites, which is interpreted by Christians as the fulfillment of God's plan for salvation.

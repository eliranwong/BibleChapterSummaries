# Numbers 36

## Subheadings

* From verse 1 - Inheritance Laws for Daughters

## Summary

Numbers 36 is the final chapter of the book of Numbers and deals with the topic of inheritance laws for daughters. The chapter begins with the chiefs of the fathers' house of the families of the sons of Gilead coming before Moses and the leaders of the Israelites to present an issue regarding the inheritance of land among their tribe.

Inheritance Laws for Daughters:
The issue presented was that if daughters inherited land from their fathers and then married outside of their tribe, the land would pass on to the husband's tribe, causing the land to be lost from the tribe of the father. To address this, Moses receives a commandment from the Lord that daughters who inherit land must marry within their own tribe so that the land remains within the family and tribe.

The Structure of the Chapter:
The chapter consists of only one section, which is the commandment given by the Lord to Moses concerning the inheritance laws for daughters. The section is presented in a narrative form, with the chiefs of the fathers' house of the families of the sons of Gilead presenting the issue to Moses, and then Moses receiving a commandment from the Lord to address the issue.

Key Verses:
The key verses in this chapter are verses 6-9, where the commandment given by the Lord is presented. It reads, "This is what the Lord commands for the daughters of Zelophehad: They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within their father’s tribal clan. No inheritance in Israel is to pass from one tribe to another, for every Israelite shall keep the tribal inheritance of their ancestors. Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone in her father’s tribal clan, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of their ancestors. No inheritance may pass from one tribe to another, for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits."

Main Themes and Messages:
The main theme of this chapter is the importance of maintaining the inheritance of land within the family and tribe. The commandment given by the Lord highlights the significance of keeping the land within the tribe and preventing it from passing on to another tribe. The message is that the land is a precious inheritance passed down from ancestors and should be protected and preserved within the family and tribe.

Historical and Cultural Context:
The inheritance laws presented in this chapter reflect the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, where land was considered a valuable asset and was passed down from father to son. The fact that daughters were allowed to inherit land was a progressive step towards gender equality, but the commandment given by the Lord still reflects the societal norms of the time, where women were expected to marry within their own tribe.

Interpretation by Theologians, Scholars, and Religious Leaders:
The interpretation of this chapter by theologians, scholars, and religious leaders is largely consistent with the themes and messages presented in the chapter. The emphasis on maintaining the inheritance of land within the family and tribe is seen as a reflection of God's desire for his people to remain connected to their heritage and ancestry.

Controversies and Popular Interpretations:

Relation to Other Chapters, Books, or Themes in the Bible:
The inheritance laws presented in this chapter are also mentioned in earlier chapters of Numbers (chapter 27), where the daughters of Zelophehad first bring their case before Moses. The theme of inheritance is also present throughout the Bible, with God promising the land of Canaan to Abraham and his descendants in the book of Genesis.

Lessons and Morals:

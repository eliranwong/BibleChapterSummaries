## Summary

1 John 2 is written by the apostle John, who writes to his audience as "little children". In this chapter, John focuses on knowing and obeying God, walking as Jesus did, and avoiding worldly temptations. He also warns his readers about false teachings and antichrists.

The chapter begins with John reassuring his readers that they have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, who is righteous and able to forgive their sins. John then reminds his readers that knowing God and obeying His commandments is crucial for experiencing true fellowship with Him. He emphasizes that those who claim to know God but do not keep His commandments are liars, and the truth is not in them.

John encourages his readers to walk as Jesus did, living a life of love and selflessness. He stresses that the old commandment to love one another is still relevant, but now it is a new commandment in Jesus Christ. John explains that loving one another is a sign of abiding in the light, while hatred and indifference towards others is a sign of walking in darkness.

John warns his readers not to love the world or the things in the world, as these things are temporary and will pass away. He cautions against the desires of the flesh, the desires of the eyes, and the pride of life. Instead, John encourages his readers to focus on doing the will of God, which will lead to eternal life.

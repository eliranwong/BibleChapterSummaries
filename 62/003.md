## Summary

1 John 3 is a chapter that discusses the love of God and how it is manifested in the lives of believers. It emphasizes the importance of righteousness and obedience in the life of a Christian, and the contrast between God's children and those who belong to the devil.

The chapter begins by reminding believers of the incredible love that God has shown them by calling them His children. The verse "See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are" (1 John 3:1) expresses the magnitude of God's love for those who have put their faith in Him.

From verse 1 to 3, the chapter explains how the children of God are set apart from the world, and how they will one day be like Christ when He appears. It states that "everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure" (1 John 3:3), indicating that the hope of Christ's return motivates believers to live righteous lives.

The chapter then moves on to discuss practicing righteousness, and how it is a sign that someone belongs to God. Verse 4 states that "everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness." This verse emphasizes the importance of practicing righteousness in the life of a Christian.

From verse 8 to 10, the chapter contrasts the children of God with the children of the devil. It states that those who do not practice righteousness do not belong to God, and those who do not love their brothers and sisters in Christ are not of God.

The message of love is then discussed from verse 11 to 18. The chapter emphasizes the importance of loving one another, and that this is a sign of belonging to God. Verse 16 states, "By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers." This verse emphasizes the sacrificial nature of love, and how believers should be willing to lay down their own lives for their brothers and sisters in Christ.

From verse 19 to 22, the chapter speaks on assurance through obedience. It states that those who keep God's commandments have the assurance of being in a right relationship with Him. Verse 22 states, "and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him." This verse emphasizes the importance of obedience in the life of a believer.

The chapter ends with verse 23, which emphasizes the importance of keeping God's commandments and abiding in Him. It states, "And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us."

In conclusion, 1 John 3 is a chapter that emphasizes the love of God and how it is manifested in the lives of believers. It emphasizes the importance of righteousness, obedience, and love, and how these are signs that someone belongs to God. This chapter also contrasts the children of God with those who belong to the devil, and emphasizes the importance of keeping God's commandments and abiding in Him.

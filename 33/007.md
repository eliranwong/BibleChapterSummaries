## Summary

Micah 7 is a chapter that speaks about the moral corruption, judgment on the wicked, trust in God, redemption, and restoration. It is a chapter that highlights the prophet Micahâ€™s lamentation over the state of Judah and what will happen to the people because of their sins. The chapter can be structured into several parts based on the subheadings:

1. The moral corruption (Verse 1-2):
The chapter begins with Micah's lamentation, where he describes himself as "like the gathering of summer fruit, like the gleaning of the grape harvest" (v.1). This means that he sees himself as the last of the remnant of faithful people and that the land is filled with wickedness. Micah continues to state that "The faithful have been swept from the land; not one upright person remains" (v.2), indicating that the people have turned away from God, and there is no longer any righteousness in the land.

2. Judgments on the wicked (Verse 3-6):
The prophet then proceeds to describe the judgment that will come upon the wicked people. He states that they are "skilled in doing evil" (v.3) and that they lie in wait for each other, deceiving and oppressing one another. Micah then warns that God will not tolerate their evil deeds, and He will bring judgment upon them. He says, "The day of your watchmen has come, the day God visits you. Now is the time of their confusion" (v.4). The people will be ashamed and humiliated because of their sins.

3. Trust no one (Verse 5-6):
Micah advises the faithful to trust in God alone because everyone, including their closest friends and family members, cannot be trusted. He states, "Do not trust a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend. Even with the woman who lies in your embrace guard the words of your lips" (v.5). This means that people should not rely on anyone but God because human beings are flawed and can fail.

4. Faithful waiting (Verse 7):
Micah then speaks about his personal faith in God, stating that he will wait for the Lord to save him. He says, "But as for me, I watch in hope for the Lord, I wait for God my Savior; my God will hear me" (v.7). This shows that despite the corruption and sinfulness around him, Micah trusts in God's faithfulness and knows that God will hear his prayers.

5. Defense and redemption (Verse 8-13):
In this section, Micah describes God's defense and redemption of His people. He says that God will come to his defense and that the people's enemies will be defeated. He says, "Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will rise. Though I sit in darkness, the Lord will be my light" (v.8). This verse shows that God will be a light in the darkness and that He will lift His people up.

6. Rebuilding and expanding (Verse 11-13):
Micah then speaks about the rebuilding and expanding of Jerusalem. He states that the walls will be rebuilt, and the city will be enlarged. He says, "In that day people will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain" (v.12). This means that God will bless His people and bring prosperity to the land.

7. Shepherd and flock (Verse 14-15):
Micah describes God as a shepherd, who will gather His flock and lead them to pasture. He says, "Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, which lives by itself in a forest, in fertile pasturelands" (v.14). This verse shows that God will take care of His people and provide for their needs.

8. The Lord's power and compassion (Verse 16):
Micah ends the chapter by describing God's power and compassion. He says, "Nations will see and be ashamed, deprived of all their power. They will put their hands over their mouths and their ears will become deaf" (v.16). This means that God will show His power to the nations, and they will be ashamed.

9. Forgiving and restoring (Verse 18):
Finally, Micah speaks about God's forgiveness and restoration of His people. He says, "Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy" (v.18). This means that God is merciful and forgiving, and He will restore His people.

In conclusion, Micah 7 is a chapter that speaks about the moral corruption, judgment on the wicked, trust in God, redemption, and restoration. It is a chapter that shows that despite the sins and corruption around us, we can trust in God's faithfulness and that He will defend and redeem His people. It is also a reminder that God is forgiving and merciful, and He will restore His people.

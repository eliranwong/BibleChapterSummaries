## Summary

Zechariah 9 is a prophetic chapter that contains a message from the Lord about the future judgment of Israel's enemies, the coming of the king, and the covenant and victory that will be established by the Lord.

Judgment on Israel's Enemies:
The chapter begins with a prophecy about Hadrach and Damascus, two cities that will come under judgment from the Lord. The Lord is watching everything, and He will bring punishment upon these cities for their wickedness. The city of Tyre is also mentioned, and it will be destroyed, and its wealth will be taken away. The Lord will protect His people, and no enemy will be able to overcome them.

The Coming of the King:
Verse 9 speaks of the coming of the king, who will be humble and will come riding on a donkey. This prophecy is fulfilled in the New Testament when Jesus enters Jerusalem on a donkey, as recorded in Matthew 21:5. The king will bring peace to the nations, and His rule will extend from sea to sea, from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.

The Covenant and Victory:
In verses 11-17, the Lord promises to establish a covenant with His people and to set them free from their enemies. He will restore their fortunes and bless them with prosperity. The Lord will protect His people and strengthen them, and they will overcome their enemies. The Lord will be with them, and they will be His people.

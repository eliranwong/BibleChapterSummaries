## Summary

Zechariah 13 is a chapter that contains two distinct subheadings. The first section, from verse 1 to 6, is entitled "A Fountain of Cleansing," while the second section, from verse 7 to 9, is known as "The Smitten Shepherd and the Scattered Flock."

The chapter begins with the prophecy of a fountain that will be opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem on a specific day. This fountain will be a source of cleansing for sin and impurity. This verse highlights the forgiveness and redemption of God, as the fountain is a symbol of His grace and mercy, which can cleanse people from all their sins. This verse also points to the future when the Messiah will come to save and redeem His people.

In verses 2 to 4, the chapter speaks about the end of false prophets and their lies. They will be ashamed of their false prophecies and will no longer be able to deceive the people. The people of Israel will no longer tolerate false prophets and will reject them. Instead, they will turn to the true prophet, who is the Messiah.

In verse 5, it is mentioned that the true prophet will have the marks of wounds on his body. This verse is a clear reference to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who suffered wounds on His body for the sake of humanity. The people will recognize Him as the true prophet and will turn to Him for salvation.

From verse 7, the chapter speaks about the smitten shepherd and the scattered flock. It prophesies the coming of a time when the shepherd will be struck, and the sheep will be scattered. This verse refers to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who was the shepherd, and His followers, who were the sheep, were scattered after His death. However, this verse also prophesies the eventual gathering of the flock under the Messiah's leadership.

In verse 8, it is mentioned that two-thirds of the people will be cut off and perish, while one-third will be left alive. This verse speaks of the judgment that will befall those who reject the Messiah. However, the remaining third that survives will be refined and purified like silver and gold.

Verse 9 concludes the chapter with the statement that God will claim the survivors as His people, and they will call Him their God. This verse is a reminder of God's faithfulness to His people and His promise to protect and provide for them.

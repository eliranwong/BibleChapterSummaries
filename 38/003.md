## Summary

Zechariah 3 is a prophetic chapter that speaks of the cleansing and restoration of the priesthood in post-exilic Judah. The chapter begins with a vision of Joshua, the high priest, standing before the angel of the Lord, with Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. This sets the stage for the rest of the chapter, which focuses on the accusation against Joshua and his subsequent cleansing and restoration.

Accusation and Cleansing (verses 1-5):
The chapter opens with a vision of Joshua, the high priest, standing before the angel of the Lord, with Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. Joshua is dressed in filthy garments, which symbolize his sinfulness. However, the Lord rebukes Satan and declares that Joshua is a "brand plucked from the fire" (verse 2). The angel then commands that Joshua's filthy garments be removed and replaced with clean ones, symbolizing his cleansing and forgiveness. The Lord then declares that he will remove Joshua's iniquity and give him a place among those who stand before him.

The Charge and Prophecy (verses 6-10):
The second half of the chapter begins with the Lord addressing Joshua directly, charging him to walk in his ways and keep his commandments. The Lord also promises Joshua that he will be given authority to govern the temple and its services. The Lord then issues a prophecy concerning the coming of his servant, the Branch, who will remove the iniquity of the land in a single day. This prophecy is a foreshadowing of the coming of Jesus Christ, who would ultimately fulfill this prophecy through his death and resurrection.

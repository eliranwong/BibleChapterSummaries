## Summary

Zechariah 6 is the last of the eight night visions that the prophet Zechariah had. This chapter starts with Zechariah seeing four chariots coming out from between two mountains of bronze. The chariots are described as being different colors, with horses of different colors. The first chariot had red horses, the second chariot had black horses, the third chariot had white horses, and the fourth chariot had strong dappled horses.

The Chariots' Description:
Zechariah's vision of the chariots represents God's judgment and His control over the nations. The four chariots represent the four winds of heaven, indicating that God was using them to accomplish His purposes in the world. The different colors of the horses signify different nations or regions, and their roles in God's plan. The chariots' description emphasizes God's sovereignty, power, and control over the nations.

The Chariots' Mission:
The mission of the chariots is to patrol the earth and report back to God. The black horses, which represent the north, have gone forth to quiet the Spirit of the Lord in the land of the north. The white horses, which represent the west, have gone forth to follow after the black horses, indicating that the west is following the north's lead. The dappled horses, which represent the south, have gone forth to patrol the earth, indicating that they're keeping watch over the earth. The red horses, which represent the east, have gone forth to seek to go throughout the earth, indicating that they're seeking to explore the earth.

The Crowning of Joshua:
The chapter then moves to the crowning of Joshua, the high priest. Zechariah is instructed to take silver and gold and make a crown and put it on Joshua's head. This act symbolizes that Joshua would be a priest and a king, indicating that the priesthood and the kingship would be merged in the person of the Messiah.

The Prophecy of the Branch:
The chapter concludes with the prophecy of the Branch, which refers to Jesus Christ. The Branch is the one who would rebuild the temple of the Lord, indicating that He would restore the worship of God. The Branch would also sit on a throne as a priest and a king, indicating that He would have both the priesthood and the kingship. The Branch would also establish peace and prosperity, indicating that He would bring salvation to the world.

The Promise of God's Presence:
The chapter ends with the promise of God's presence. The Lord promises to be with His people and to dwell among them. The Lord promises to return to Jerusalem and to make it His dwelling place, indicating that He would establish His kingdom on earth.

In conclusion, Zechariah 6 is a powerful chapter that reveals God's sovereignty, his plan for the nations, and His promise to send the Messiah. The chapter emphasizes the merging of the priesthood and kingship in the person of Jesus Christ, who would restore the worship of God and establish His kingdom on earth. The chapter also emphasizes the promise of God's presence with His people, indicating that He would never leave them nor forsake them.

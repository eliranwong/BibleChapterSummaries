From verse 1 - The Rejection of the Shepherd

## Summary

Zechariah 11 is a prophetic chapter in the Old Testament book of Zechariah. The chapter begins with a call to Lebanon to open its doors so that fire may consume its cedars. This is a symbolic representation of the impending judgment of God on the disobedient people of Israel. 

The chapter is structured into two main sections, the rejection of the shepherd and the breaking of the staffs. Each section contains subheadings that further expound on the message being conveyed. 

In the first section, the rejection of the shepherd, Zechariah portrays God as a shepherd who is rejected by his flock. He commands the prophet to act as a shepherd for the people of Israel. However, the people reject him and he is forced to break the staffs of the flock. This symbolizes the breaking of the covenant between God and his people. 

Key verses in this section include verse 4, "This is what the Lord my God says: 'Shepherd the flock marked for slaughter.'" This verse emphasizes the judgment that is to come upon the disobedient people of Israel. 

The second section of the chapter, the breaking of the staffs, further expounds on the judgment that is to come upon the people of Israel. The chapter portrays the people of Israel as a flock that is being led to slaughter. They are oppressed by their leaders, who are described as worthless shepherds. 

Significant characters in this chapter include the shepherd, who represents God, and the worthless shepherds, who represent the corrupt leaders of Israel. The chapter also mentions the two staffs of God, which are named Favor and Union. These staffs represent the covenant between God and his people, which is broken by the rejection of the shepherd. 

The main theme of this chapter is the judgment of God upon the disobedient people of Israel. The chapter emphasizes the importance of obedience to God and the consequences of disobedience. It also highlights the role of leaders in guiding the people towards righteousness. 

To understand the context of this chapter, it is important to note that it was written during the post-exilic period when the people of Israel had returned from Babylonian captivity. The people were struggling to rebuild their nation and re-establish their relationship with God. 

Scholars and theologians have interpreted this chapter in various ways. Some see it as a warning to the corrupt leaders of Israel, while others see it as a message of hope for the people who are oppressed. 

One controversial interpretation of this chapter is the idea that it predicts the coming of Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd. This interpretation is based on the idea that Jesus fulfills the role of the shepherd who is rejected by his people. 

Zechariah 11 is connected to other chapters and themes in the Bible. It is similar in theme to other prophetic books, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah. It also connects to the theme of the Messiah as the Good Shepherd, which is further developed in the New Testament. 

The main lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of obedience to God and the consequences of disobedience. It also emphasizes the role of leaders in guiding the people towards righteousness.

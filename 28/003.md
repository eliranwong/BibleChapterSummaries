## Summary

Hosea chapter 3 is a continuation of the previous chapter where God had instructed Hosea to marry Gomer, who was a prostitute, as a symbol of Israel's unfaithfulness to Him. This chapter takes us through God's command to Hosea to love Gomer again, Hosea's redemption of Gomer and the period of trial and return to God.

The chapter begins with God commanding Hosea to go and love Gomer again, despite her unfaithfulness to him. This was a reflection of God's love for Israel, who had turned away from Him and worshipped other gods. God's love for Israel was unwavering, just as Hosea's love for Gomer was unshaken, despite her unfaithfulness.

Hosea obeys God's command and goes to redeem Gomer, who had been sold into slavery. This symbolizes God's redemption of Israel, who had been taken into captivity due to their disobedience. Hosea buys Gomer back with fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a half of barley, which was a high price to pay for a slave. This shows the extent to which Hosea was willing to go to redeem Gomer, just as God was willing to go to great lengths to redeem Israel.

After redeeming Gomer, Hosea instructs her to remain faithful to him and to stop her adulterous ways. This was a reflection of God's instruction to Israel to turn away from their idolatry and return to Him. Hosea tells Gomer that she will have to wait for him for a long time and that she will not have any intimate relationships with anyone else. This was a period of trial for Gomer, just as Israel had to go through a period of trial and repentance before returning to God.

The chapter ends with a message of hope, as Hosea tells Gomer that she will return to him and that they will be united once again. This symbolizes God's promise of restoration to Israel, who had turned away from Him. The chapter emphasizes God's unconditional love for His people, despite their unfaithfulness and disobedience.

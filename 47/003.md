## Summary

2 Corinthians 3 is a letter from the apostle Paul to the church in Corinth. In this chapter, Paul addresses the issue of letters of recommendation, emphasizes the importance of dependence on God, and compares the glory of the old covenant with that of the new covenant.

Letters of Recommendation (verses 1-3):
Paul begins by addressing the issue of letters of recommendation. He questions whether it is necessary for him or other ministers to have letters of recommendation from the Corinthians or elsewhere. Paul argues that the Corinthians themselves are his letter of recommendation, as they are the result of his ministry in Christ and are known and read by all.

Dependence on God (verses 4-6):
In verses 4-6, Paul emphasizes the importance of dependence on God. He states that he and his fellow ministers are not sufficient in themselves to claim anything as coming from themselves, but their sufficiency comes from God. Paul contrasts the new covenant with the old covenant, stating that the old covenant was a ministry of death, while the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit, which gives life.

The Greater Glory of the New Covenant (verses 7-18):
Verses 7-18 compare the glory of the old covenant with that of the new covenant. Paul argues that the old covenant, which was written on stone, was a ministry of condemnation, while the new covenant, which is written on the heart, is a ministry of righteousness. He also states that the glory of the old covenant was temporary, while the glory of the new covenant is permanent. Paul concludes by emphasizing the freedom that comes through the Spirit and the transformation that occurs as we behold the glory of the Lord.

The main themes of this chapter are the sufficiency of God, the contrast between the old and new covenants, and the importance of transformation through the Spirit. The historical and cultural context of this chapter is the early Christian church and the challenges faced by Paul and other ministers in spreading the gospel. 

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter in different ways. Some see it as emphasizing the importance of spiritual transformation in the Christian life, while others focus on the contrast between the old and new covenants. There are also debates over whether Paul is criticizing the use of letters of recommendation or simply stating that they are unnecessary.

This chapter relates to other passages in the New Testament that emphasize the importance of the Spirit and the new covenant, such as Romans 8 and Hebrews 8-10. It also ties into the larger themes of the Bible, such as God's faithfulness and the importance of transformation and renewal.

In terms of lessons or morals, this chapter emphasizes the importance of dependence on God and the transformative power of the Spirit. It also reminds us of the temporary nature of physical things and the permanent nature of spiritual things.

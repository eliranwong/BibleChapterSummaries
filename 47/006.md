## Summary

2 Corinthians 6 is a letter written by Paul, the apostle, to the Corinthian church. This chapter can be divided into two parts: Paul's appeal for their openness and his call to separate from unbelievers.

The chapter begins with Paul appealing to the Corinthians to not receive the grace of God in vain. He encourages them to receive the grace of God with gratitude and to work with Him. He then goes on to describe the hardships he and his companions have faced in their ministry, such as afflictions, hardships, and beatings.

In verse 3, Paul says that they have endured these hardships without causing anyone to stumble. He then uses a series of contrasts to describe the ministry he and his companions have undertaken. They have been honored and dishonored, spoken well of and spoken ill of, seen as deceivers and yet truthful.

Paul then makes an appeal to the Corinthians to open up their hearts to him and his companions. He says that they have not withheld their love from the Corinthians but that the Corinthians have withheld their love from them. He urges them to reciprocate their love and to open up their hearts to them.

From verse 14, Paul shifts his focus to the issue of separation from unbelievers. He urges the Corinthians to not be yoked with unbelievers, as there is no common ground between light and darkness. He gives examples of how believers and unbelievers have nothing in common, such as righteousness and lawlessness, Christ and Belial, and the temple of God and idols.

Paul then calls on the Corinthians to come out from among unbelievers and be separate. He says that God will welcome them and be their Father, and they will be His sons and daughters. He urges them to cleanse themselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

The main themes in this chapter are the importance of receiving the grace of God, enduring hardships in ministry, opening up one's heart to others, and separating from unbelievers. Paul emphasizes the need for believers to be set apart and to live holy lives, avoiding being yoked with unbelievers.

To fully understand this chapter, it is important to know the historical and cultural context. The Corinthian church was located in a city known for its immorality and idol worship. Paul's message to separate from unbelievers was a call to avoid being influenced by the sinful practices of the city.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter as a call to personal holiness and a warning against compromising one's faith by being yoked with unbelievers. Some have also interpreted this chapter as a call to evangelism, as believers are called to be separate from the world but also to be in the world and share the gospel.

There are some controversies related to this chapter, particularly in regards to how to apply the principle of separation from unbelievers in today's context. Some have argued that it can lead to isolationism and a lack of engagement with the world, while others have argued that it is important for believers to maintain a distinct identity and avoid being influenced by the world.

Overall, the main lesson from this chapter is the importance of living a holy life and avoiding being yoked with unbelievers. As believers, we are called to be set apart and to live in a way that honors God.

## Summary

2 Corinthians 1 is a letter written by the apostle Paul to the church in Corinth and to all the saints in the region of Achaia. The chapter is divided into several sections that deal with different topics.

Greetings:

The chapter begins with Paul introducing himself as an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy as his brother. He then greets the church in Corinth and all the saints in the region of Achaia.

Comfort in Suffering:

In verses 3-7, Paul encourages the Corinthians to take comfort in God, who is the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort. Paul shares that he has experienced suffering himself, but God has comforted him, and he is now able to comfort others who are going through similar trials. Paul emphasizes that just as they share in his sufferings, they will also share in his comfort.

Paul's Deliverance from Persecution:

In verses 8-11, Paul recounts a specific instance of persecution in Asia where he and his companions had despaired of life itself. However, God delivered them from such a great peril, and Paul expresses his trust in God's ongoing protection and deliverance.

Paul's Integrity and Motives:

In verses 12-14, Paul defends his integrity and motives to the Corinthians. He declares that his actions and words have been conducted in holiness and sincerity that are from God, not from his own fleshly desires. Paul also affirms that he has acted with the grace of God, and this is the basis of his confidence.

The Change of Plans Explained:

In verses 15-17, Paul explains why he had not yet visited Corinth after promising to do so. Paul states that he had intended to visit them twice, but he had changed his plans because he did not want to cause them sorrow. Instead, he sent them a letter to express his love for them and to encourage them.

The Purpose of the Delay:

In verses 23-24, Paul explains that he had not yet visited them because he wanted to spare them from any possible negative impact that could arise from the confrontation between himself and the rebellious members of the church. Paul affirms that he is not trying to lord it over their faith, but rather is a fellow worker for their joy.

The main themes of 2 Corinthians 1 are comfort, suffering, and God's faithfulness in delivering His people. The chapter shows how Paul himself has experienced God's comfort in the midst of suffering and how he is able to share that comfort with others. It also demonstrates how Paul's trust in God allows him to face persecution with confidence and how his integrity and motives are grounded in God's grace. Finally, the chapter reveals how Paul's change of plans and delay in visiting the Corinthians were motivated by his desire to spare them from any negative impact of the confrontation.

The historical and cultural context of 2 Corinthians 1 is important to understand. At the time of writing, the church in Corinth was facing internal divisions and challenges to Paul's authority. In this context, Paul is writing to defend his integrity and motives and to encourage the Corinthians to take comfort in God's faithfulness.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted 2 Corinthians 1 in various ways. Some see it as a model for Christian comfort and suffering, while others focus on Paul's defense of his apostolic authority. There are also debates about the specific circumstances that led to Paul's change of plans and his delay in visiting Corinth.

In summary, 2 Corinthians 1 is a chapter that emphasizes the importance of comfort, suffering, and God's faithfulness in the life of a Christian.

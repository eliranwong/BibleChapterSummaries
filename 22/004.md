## Summary

Song of Songs 4 is a love poem between two lovers, the Beloved and the Shulamite, and it depicts their deep affection and admiration for each other. This chapter is structured into three parts: The Beloved praising the Shulamite's beauty (verses 1-7), the Invitation to consummate their love (verses 8-15), and the Shulamite's Invitation and Consummation (verse 16).

The chapter begins with the Beloved praising the Shulamite's beauty, describing her as "beautiful" and comparing her eyes to "doves behind a veil" and her hair to a "flock of goats descending from the hills of Gilead" (verse 1). This imagery is used to convey the beauty, purity, and gracefulness of the Shulamite. The Beloved continues to praise her physical attributes, such as her teeth, lips, and temples (verses 2-5), and also her character, describing her as a "garden locked up, a spring enclosed, a sealed fountain" (verse 12). These metaphors suggest that the Shulamite is a precious treasure that is only meant for the Beloved.

In the second part of the chapter, the Beloved invites the Shulamite to come with him to the mountains and hills, where they can enjoy each other's company and consummate their love (verses 8-15). The Beloved uses nature imagery to describe the beauty of the surroundings and the pleasure they will experience together. He also affirms his love for her and his desire to be with her, saying "You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride; you have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes" (verse 9).

In the final part of the chapter, the Shulamite responds to the Beloved's invitation and consummates their love (verse 16). She invites him to come to her garden and enjoy the fruits of her labor, symbolizing the intimacy and satisfaction they share.

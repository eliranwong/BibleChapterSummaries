## Summary

Haggai 2 is a prophetic message from the Lord delivered through the prophet Haggai to the people of Judah who had returned from exile in Babylon. It is a message of encouragement and hope as the people were facing difficult times in rebuilding the temple and restoring their nation. The chapter can be divided into several sections based on its subheadings.

Prophetic date and context (verses 1-2):
The chapter begins with the prophet Haggai giving the date when the word of the Lord came to him. It was on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, which corresponds to the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles. This festival was a time of great joy and celebration when the people would dwell in booths to commemorate their wilderness wanderings. The context of the chapter is important because it shows that the Lord was speaking to the people during a significant time in their religious calendar.

Questioning the temple's glory (verses 3-4):
The second section of the chapter begins with the Lord addressing the people's concerns about the glory of the new temple they were building. The people were discouraged because the new temple did not seem as glorious as the temple Solomon had built. The Lord reminds them that the glory of the temple is not in its physical appearance but in His presence. He encourages them to be strong and continue the work of building the temple.

Encouragement to be strong (verse 4):
The Lord encourages the people to be strong and to not be afraid. He tells them that He is with them and that His Spirit is among them. This is a message of hope and assurance that God is with them and will help them complete the work He has called them to do.

Reminder of God's covenant (verse 5):
The Lord reminds the people of His covenant with them when they came out of Egypt. He promises to be with them and to keep His covenant with them. This is an important reminder of God's faithfulness to His people and His promises to them.

A great shaking (verse 6):
The Lord speaks of a great shaking that will come upon the earth, the sea, and the nations. This shaking is a reference to a time of judgment and upheaval that will come upon the world. It is a warning to the people to repent and turn back to the Lord before it is too late.

The wealth of nations (verse 7):
The Lord promises that the wealth of the nations will be brought to the new temple. This is a message of encouragement to the people that the temple will be glorious and that they will have everything they need to complete the work.

Greater glory and peace (verse 9):
The Lord promises that the new temple will have greater glory than the former temple, and that He will bring peace to the land. This is a message of hope and assurance that God will bless the people if they continue to obey Him and do His will.

Inquiry about ritual purity (verse 10):
The priests ask the Lord about the issue of ritual purity. They want to know if the people who are unclean can still offer sacrifices. This is an important question because it shows that the people are concerned about obeying the law of Moses and doing things the right way.

The priests' answers (verse 12):
The Lord answers the priests' questions about ritual purity. He tells them that if something unclean touches something clean, the clean thing does not become unclean. This is a message of reassurance to the priests that they can still offer sacrifices even if they have been in contact with something unclean.

Past consequences (verses 15-17):
The Lord reminds the people that in the past, their disobedience had led to punishment and hardship. He encourages them to turn back to Him and obey His commands so that they may be blessed.

Commitment to obedience (verse 18):
The people respond to the Lord's message by committing themselves to obey His commands. They recognize that their past disobedience had led to punishment, and they want to avoid making the same mistakes again.

The Day of Overthrow and Judgment (verse 20):
The Lord speaks of a day of overthrow and judgment that will come upon the nations. This is a warning to the people to repent and turn back to the Lord before it is too late.

The coming shake up (verses 21-22):
The Lord promises to shake the heavens and the earth, and to overthrow the thrones of kingdoms. This is a message of judgment and warning to the nations to repent and turn back to the Lord.

Zerubbabel as God's chosen servant (verse 23):
The chapter ends with the Lord speaking of Zerubbabel as His chosen servant. He promises to make him like a signet ring, which is a symbol of authority and honor. This is a message of encouragement to Zerubbabel and to the people that God has chosen them and will help them complete the work He has called them to do.

In conclusion, Haggai 2 is a message of hope, encouragement, and warning to the people of Judah. It is a reminder of God's faithfulness to His people, His promises to them, and His desire for them to obey Him. The chapter also contains warnings of judgment and upheaval for those who do not repent and turn back to the Lord. Overall, the main theme of the chapter is the importance of obeying God and trusting in His faithfulness.

## Summary

Haggai 1 is a prophetic call by the prophet Haggai to the governor of Judah, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak, to rebuild the house of the Lord. The chapter is set in the second year of King Darius, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, when the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai.

Prophetic Call of Haggai:
Haggai begins by delivering the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel and Joshua, calling them to rebuild the house of the Lord. He asks them why they are dwelling in paneled houses while the house of the Lord lies in ruins. He urges them to consider their ways and to return to the Lord.

The time is not right:
The people respond by saying that the time is not right for rebuilding the house of the Lord. They claim that they are still struggling to provide for their own households and cannot afford to rebuild the temple. Haggai rebukes them for their lack of faith and trust in the Lord. He tells them that the Lord will not bless their efforts until they prioritize the rebuilding of his house.

The people's comfort prioritized:
Haggai then encourages Zerubbabel and Joshua to take courage and begin the work of rebuilding the temple. He assures them that the Lord is with them and will provide for their needs. Zerubbabel and Joshua obey the word of the Lord and begin to rebuild the temple.

Call to reflection:
Haggai then calls on the people to reflect on their current situation and to consider the consequences of neglecting the house of the Lord. He reminds them that they have sown much but harvested little, and that the Lord has withheld his blessings because they have neglected his house.

God's response to their neglect:
The Lord responds to the people's neglect by sending drought and famine, causing them to suffer. He calls on them to repent and to return to him. He promises to be with them and to bless them if they obey his word and rebuild his house.

Obedience of Zerubbabel and Joshua:
Zerubbabel and Joshua obey the word of the Lord and begin to rebuild the temple. The people are motivated by their obedience and begin to contribute to the rebuilding effort.

The people's motivation:
The people are motivated by the obedience of Zerubbabel and Joshua and begin to contribute to the rebuilding effort. The Lord promises to be with them and to bless them.

The start of the rebuilding:
The chapter ends with the start of the rebuilding of the temple. The people obey the word of the Lord and begin to work on the temple. They are motivated by the promise of the Lord's blessings and the obedience of their leaders.

The main theme of Haggai 1 is the importance of prioritizing the house of the Lord and obeying his word. The chapter also emphasizes the consequences of neglecting the Lord's house and the blessings that come with obedience.

The historical context of Haggai 1 is important to understand the chapter. The chapter is set in the time of the restoration of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the temple after the Babylonian exile. The people are struggling to rebuild their lives and their city, and the rebuilding of the temple is an important part of this process.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted Haggai 1 as a call to the church to prioritize the worship of God and the building of his kingdom. The chapter has also been interpreted as a warning against neglecting the house of the Lord and the blessings that come with obedience.

There are no significant controversies related to Haggai 1, but the chapter has been used by some to support the idea of the prosperity gospel, which emphasizes material blessings as a result of obedience to God.

Haggai 1 relates to other chapters and books in the Bible that emphasize the importance of worshiping God and obeying his word. It also relates to the broader themes of restoration and redemption in the Bible.

The lesson that can be taken from Haggai 1 is the importance of putting God first in our lives and obeying his word. The chapter reminds us that neglecting the house of the Lord will result in consequences, but obedience to God will bring blessings.

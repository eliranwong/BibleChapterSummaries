## Summary

Psalms 22 is a prayer of lamentation and trust in God in the midst of deep suffering. The chapter begins with the cry of the forsaken Messiah, "My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?" (v.1). This verse is significant because it is quoted by Jesus on the cross in Matthew 27:46, indicating that this psalm is a prophecy of his suffering and death.

The chapter is structured around the themes of suffering, faith, and deliverance. In the midst of his suffering, the psalmist maintains his faith and trust in God. Verse 3 says, "But You are holy, enthroned in the praises of Israel." This is a declaration of God's greatness and faithfulness even in the midst of suffering.

The psalmist describes the humiliation and scorn he experiences in verses 6-8. He is mocked and ridiculed by those who pass by, and his enemies taunt him, saying, "He trusted in the Lord, let Him rescue him" (v.8). This can be seen as a picture of the suffering of the Messiah, who was also mocked and ridiculed by those around him.

Verse 9 speaks of the psalmist's relationship with God since childhood, saying, "But You are He who took me out of the womb; You made me trust while on my mother's breasts." This is a reminder that God has been faithful to the psalmist throughout his life, and he can trust Him even in the midst of suffering.

In verse 11, the psalmist pleads for God's help in his distress, saying, "Be not far from me, for trouble is near; for there is none to help." He acknowledges his need for God's intervention and asks for His presence and protection.

The physical and emotional torment of the sufferer is described in detail in verses 14-18. He is weakened and drained, and his enemies surround him like a pack of dogs. He feels as if his bones are out of joint and his heart is melting within him. This vivid description of the suffering of the psalmist can also be seen as a prophetic picture of the suffering of the Messiah.

In verse 19, the psalmist makes a final plea for deliverance, saying, "But You, O Lord, do not be far from me; O my Strength, hasten to help me!" This is a desperate cry for God's intervention and rescue.

Verse 22 marks a turning point in the chapter, as the psalmist begins to praise and proclaim God's greatness and faithfulness. He says, "I will declare Your name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly I will praise You." This is a declaration of his faith in God's deliverance, even in the midst of suffering.

The chapter concludes with a reflection on the far-reaching impact of the sufferer's deliverance. Verse 28 says, "For the kingdom is the Lord's, and He rules over the nations." This is a reminder that God is in control and that His deliverance has a greater purpose beyond the individual suffering of the psalmist.

In terms of historical and cultural context, this psalm is believed to have been written by King David, but it is also seen as a prophetic psalm about the suffering and death of Jesus. It is a reminder that even in the midst of suffering, we can trust in God's faithfulness and goodness.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter in a variety of ways, but it is generally seen as a powerful expression of faith and trust in the midst of suffering. Some have also seen it as a reminder of the importance of community and the need to proclaim God's faithfulness to others.

There are some popular interpretations and controversies related to this chapter, particularly in relation to its prophetic significance for the suffering of Jesus. Some have debated whether the psalm was written specifically about Jesus or whether it is a more general prophecy of a suffering Messiah.

Overall, Psalms 22 is a powerful expression of faith in the midst of suffering. It reminds us that even when we feel forsaken and alone, we can trust in God's faithfulness and goodness.

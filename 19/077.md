## Summary

Psalm 77 is a deeply personal and emotional prayer of a psalmist who is crying out to God in despair and seeking His help. The psalm is attributed to Asaph, one of the chief musicians and singers in King David's court, and is dedicated to Jeduthun, another musician. The psalm is divided into six sections, each with its own theme and structure.

The first section, from verse 1 to 3, is an introduction where the psalmist expresses his desperation and cries out to God for help. He says that he is in distress and cannot sleep, and he is calling out to God with his voice. The psalmist is seeking comfort and reassurance from God, and he believes that God will listen to his plea.

The second section, from verse 3 to 6, is a reflection on the psalmist's sleepless nights. He is tormented by his thoughts and cannot find rest. He is questioning God and wondering if God has rejected him forever. However, he still holds on to his faith and remembers the times when God has helped him in the past.

The third section, from verse 7 to 10, is a recollection of God's past faithfulness. The psalmist is remembering the times when God has been there for him and has helped him in his distress. He is asking God to remember His mercy and compassion, and to show him the same kindness that he has shown in the past.

The fourth section, from verse 11 to 15, is a meditation on God's wondrous works. The psalmist is reflecting on God's greatness and power, and he is marveling at the things that God has done in the past. He is asking God to help him understand His ways and to guide him in his life.

The fifth section, from verse 16 to 19, is a recognition of God's control over nature. The psalmist is acknowledging that God is in control of the universe and that He can do anything He wants. He is recalling the time when God parted the Red Sea for the Israelites and saved them from the Egyptians.

Overall, the main themes of Psalm 77 are faith, trust, and hope in God. The psalmist is going through a difficult time, but he still believes that God is listening to his prayers and will help him. He is remembering the times when God has helped him in the past, and he is holding on to his faith in God's goodness and mercy.

To understand the historical context of this psalm, it is important to note that it was written during a time of national crisis for Israel. The nation was facing military threats and political instability, and the people were turning to God for help and guidance. The psalmist's struggles and emotions reflect the mood of the people at that time.

In terms of interpretations, some scholars see this psalm as a model for prayer and worship. It shows how a person can come to God with their raw emotions and struggles, and still have faith and trust in Him. Others see it as a reminder of God's sovereignty and power, and how we should always remember His past faithfulness in our lives.

There are no major controversies related to this psalm, but some scholars debate the exact meaning of certain passages and phrases. For example, the phrase "Selah" which appears several times in the psalm is of uncertain meaning, and its purpose in the text is not clear.

Psalm 77 is also connected to other psalms and themes in the Bible, such as the theme of God's faithfulness and mercy, which appears throughout the Book of Psalms. It also relates to the theme of God's control over nature and His power to save His people, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament.

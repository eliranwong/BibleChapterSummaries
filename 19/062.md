## Summary

Psalm 62 is a psalm of David and is dedicated to the music director, according to yedutun. The chapter is a reflection on the confidence and trust that the psalmist has in God alone, despite the adversities that he faces in his life. The psalmist affirms that his soul is silent towards God, meaning that he places his trust and confidence in God alone for his salvation.

The chapter is structured in five subheadings, each emphasizing a specific aspect of the psalmist's trust in God. The first subheading, from verse 1, introduces the theme of the chapter, which is the psalmist's confidence in God alone. He declares that his soul is silent towards God, meaning that he does not seek help or salvation from any other source except God.

In the second subheading, from verse 3, the psalmist addresses his adversaries and their deceitful actions. He acknowledges that his enemies plot to overthrow him, but he remains steadfast in his trust in God. He describes his enemies as a "tottering wall" and a "fence that has been pushed over." This shows that the psalmist understands the weakness and instability of his enemies and the temporary nature of their power.

The third subheading, from verse 5, reaffirms the psalmist's trust in God. He declares that God alone is his rock and salvation, and that he will not be shaken. He encourages others to put their trust in God and not in man, as man's power is fleeting and unreliable.

In the fourth subheading, from verse 9, the psalmist emphasizes the contrast between God's power and human weakness. He acknowledges that all people are inherently weak and fleeting, like a breath or a passing shadow. In contrast, God is strong and everlasting, and His power is not limited by human weakness.

The fifth and final subheading, from verse 11, concludes the chapter with a declaration of God's strength and loving kindness. The psalmist acknowledges that God is powerful and just, and that He rewards each person according to their deeds. He encourages all to put their trust in God, for He is a refuge and a stronghold for those who seek Him.

The main theme of Psalm 62 is the psalmist's confidence in God alone. He trusts in God's power and salvation, even in the face of adversity and deceitful enemies. The psalmist emphasizes the contrast between God's everlasting strength and human weakness, encouraging all to put their trust in God.

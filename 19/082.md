## Summary

Psalm 82 is a unique psalm written by Asaph, one of the chief musicians during the reign of King David. The psalm is a poetic representation of a divine council, where God, as the divine judge, calls upon the other gods or divine beings to hold them accountable for their unjust actions. The psalm is structured into four distinct sections, each with its own message and theme.

Introduction: Call to the Divine Council (Verse 1)
The psalm begins with Asaph calling upon the divine council to gather before God. Asaph uses the Hebrew term "El" to refer to God, which is usually translated as "God" or "Mighty One." Asaph then describes God as standing among the divine beings, passing judgment over them. This opening verse sets the stage for the rest of the psalm, as God calls upon the divine beings to account for their unjust behavior.

Rebuke of the Unjust Rulers (Verses 2-4)
In this section, God rebukes the unjust rulers and judges, who are referred to as "gods." God accuses them of failing to uphold justice and of showing favoritism towards the wicked. God reminds them that they too are mortal and will face judgment for their actions. The psalmist then challenges the rulers to defend the weak and the fatherless, to uphold justice for the poor and the oppressed.

Consequences of the Rulers' Failure (Verses 5-7)
In this section, the psalmist describes the consequences of the rulers' failure to uphold justice. The earth is described as being in a state of chaos, with the foundations of society being shaken. The rulers are accused of being ignorant and unwise, causing harm to the people they were supposed to serve. The psalmist concludes by reminding them that they too will die like mortals, and that their power and authority will not save them from the judgment of God.

Appeal for Divine Judgment (Verse 8)
The psalm concludes with a prayer for divine judgment, as the psalmist appeals to God to judge the rulers and to restore justice to the earth. The psalmist prays that God would arise and judge the earth, for all nations belong to Him.

The main themes of the psalm are justice, accountability, and divine judgment. The psalmist challenges the rulers to uphold justice, reminding them of their mortality and the accountability they have before God. The psalmist also acknowledges the need for divine judgment, calling upon God to restore justice to the earth.

To understand the context of this psalm, it is important to note that the concept of a divine council was common in ancient Near Eastern religions. The psalmist uses this concept to convey the idea that even the divine beings are accountable to God and must uphold justice.

Scholars and theologians have interpreted this psalm in various ways, with some suggesting that it refers to earthly rulers and judges, while others suggest that it refers to angelic beings or to the gods of other nations. There is also a debate over the identity of the divine beings in the psalm, with some suggesting they are angels, while others argue that they are human judges.

In terms of lessons or morals, Psalm 82 reminds us of the importance of justice and accountability in leadership. Whether in a secular or religious context, those in positions of power and authority have a responsibility to uphold justice and to serve the needs of the people they lead. The psalm also reminds us that we are all accountable to a higher authority, and that our actions will ultimately be judged by God.

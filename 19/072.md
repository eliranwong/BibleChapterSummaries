## Summary

Psalms 72 is a prayer for the king, and it is believed to have been written by David for his son Solomon, who would succeed him as king of Israel. The chapter begins with a plea for God to give his judgments and righteousness to the king, indicating the importance of divine guidance in the rule of a monarch.

The structure of the chapter is organized around the qualities and actions of the king, as well as the blessings that come from his reign. The first section, from verse two to verse seven, describes the king's leadership and qualities, including justice, righteousness, and compassion for the poor and needy. The following section, from verse eight to verse eleven, highlights the extent of the king's reign, which would encompass all nations and all peoples.

Verse twelve marks a shift in focus, as the chapter moves to the king's compassion and care for his people. The king is described as defending the needy and saving the children of the poor, and he is praised for his commitment to justice and righteousness. In verse fifteen, the chapter turns to the prosperity and blessings that come from the king's reign, including an abundance of grain and fruit and a flourishing economy.

The chapter concludes with a final prayer of praise and thanksgiving to God, recognizing him as the source of all blessings and the one who enables the king to rule with justice and righteousness.

One of the key verses in the chapter is verse four, which states, "He will bring justice to the poor of the people; He will save the children of the needy and will break in pieces the oppressor." This verse emphasizes the importance of justice and compassion in the king's reign and sets the tone for the rest of the chapter.

Another significant aspect of the chapter is the use of symbolism, particularly in the description of the king's reign as encompassing all nations and all peoples. This imagery reflects the belief that the king of Israel was chosen by God to rule over all the earth and to bring peace and prosperity to all people.

The main themes of the chapter include justice, righteousness, compassion, and prosperity. These themes are reflected in the descriptions of the king's leadership and qualities, as well as in the blessings that come from his reign.

To fully understand the chapter, it is important to consider the historical and cultural context in which it was written. The Israelites were a people who had experienced both prosperity and oppression, and they looked to their kings as leaders who could bring them peace and security.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter in various ways, with some seeing it as a prophecy of the coming of Christ and others viewing it as a reflection of the ideal ruler. Many religious leaders have used this chapter as a basis for prayers for their own leaders, asking God to guide them in their leadership and to grant them justice and righteousness.

There are no significant controversies or popular interpretations related to this chapter, but it is often cited as a source of inspiration for leaders seeking to rule with justice and compassion.

Psalms 72 is also connected to other chapters and themes in the Bible, particularly those related to the idea of a chosen people and a chosen ruler. It is often read in conjunction with other psalms that praise God for his sovereignty and his care for his people.

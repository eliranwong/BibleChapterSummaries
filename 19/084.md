## Summary

Psalm 84 is a psalm of the sons of Korah, written for the director of music on the Gittith. The chapter is structured into three main sections: longing for God's presence, strength and joy in the journey toward God's presence, and trusting in God's protection and blessings.

The first section, from verse 1, expresses a deep longing for God's presence and a desire to be in His dwelling place. The psalmist declares how lovely God's dwelling places are and how his soul longs, even faints, for the courts of the Lord. He expresses his envy for even the birds who have found a home near God's altar. The psalmist recognizes that those who dwell in God's house are blessed and happy, and he desires to be among them.

The second section, from verse 5, talks about the journey towards God's presence. The psalmist describes the strength and joy that come from walking with God. He recognizes that as they pass through the Valley of Baca (a place of weeping), God's grace and provision sustain them, and they become stronger and more joyful as they draw closer to Him. The psalmist encourages all who put their trust in God to keep moving forward, as each step brings them closer to the ultimate goal of being in God's presence.

The final section, from verse 9, talks about trusting in God's protection and blessings. The psalmist recognizes that God is their shield and protector, and that all who trust in Him will be blessed. He prays for God's favor and protection, acknowledging that even one day in God's presence is better than a thousand elsewhere. The psalmist concludes by affirming that God is a sun and shield, and that He grants grace and glory to all who walk uprightly.

The main theme of Psalm 84 is a longing for God's presence and a recognition that walking with Him brings strength, joy, and blessings. The psalmist encourages all who trust in God to continue on the journey, no matter what challenges they may face, as the ultimate reward is being in God's presence.

To fully understand this chapter, it is important to consider the historical and cultural context in which it was written. The sons of Korah were a group of Levites who were responsible for the music in the temple during the time of David and Solomon. As such, this psalm was likely written for use in temple worship services.

Scholars and theologians interpret this chapter as a reflection of the deep longing for God's presence that is common to all believers. It is also seen as a metaphor for the spiritual journey towards God, and a reminder that even in difficult times, God's grace and provision are sufficient.

There are no significant controversies associated with this chapter, and it is generally regarded as a source of encouragement and inspiration for believers.

Psalm 84 is closely related to other psalms that express a similar theme of longing for God's presence, such as Psalm 42 and 63. It also connects to larger themes in the Bible, such as the importance of worship and the blessings that come from trusting in God.

The main lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of seeking God's presence and trusting in Him, even in difficult times. It reminds believers that the ultimate reward is being in God's presence, and that the journey towards that goal is filled with blessings and joy.

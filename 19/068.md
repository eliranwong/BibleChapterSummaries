Introduction: An Appeal to God's Strength
The chapter begins with a call to God's strength and power. The first verse says, "Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him." This verse highlights the fact that God is all-powerful and can defeat his enemies with ease. It is a call for all those who believe in God to trust in his strength and seek his help.

God's Care for Israel
The next section of the chapter talks about God's care for Israel. Verses 4-6 say, "Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name Jah, and rejoice before him. A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation. God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land." These verses show how God is a loving father who takes care of those who are in need. He provides for the fatherless and the widows, and he rescues those who are bound.

God's Greatness in Israel's Journey
The next section of the chapter talks about God's greatness in Israel's journey. Verses 7-10 say, "O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah: The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel. Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary. Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor." These verses highlight how God guided Israel through the wilderness and protected them from harm. They also show how God provided for his people and gave them the strength to overcome their challenges.

God's Protection in Battle
The next section of the chapter talks about God's protection in battle. Verses 11-14 say, "The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it. Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil. Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon." These verses highlight how God protected his people in battle and defeated their enemies. They also show how God rewarded his people for their faithfulness and dedication to him.

God's Presence on Zion
The next section of the chapter talks about God's presence on Zion. Verses 15-18 say, "The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan. Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the Lord will dwell in it for ever. The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place. Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among them." These verses highlight how God's presence is on Zion and how he rewards those who are loyal to him. They also show how God is present in the world and how he guides and protects his people.

Praise to God for His Deliverance
The next section of the chapter talks about praise to God for his deliverance. Verses 19-23 say, "Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah. He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto God the Lord belong the issues from death. But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses. The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea. That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same." These verses highlight how God is the source of salvation and how he delivers his people from their enemies. They also show how God is a powerful and loving God who cares for his people.

God's Majestic Procession
The next section of the chapter talks about God's majestic procession. Verses 24-27 say, "They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels. Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel. There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali." These verses highlight how God's majesty is on display and how he is worshipped by his people. They also show how all of God's people are united in their worship of him.

God's Blessings on the Righteous
The next section of the chapter talks about God's blessings on the righteous. Verses 28-31 say, "Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us. Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee. Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war. Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God." These verses highlight how God blesses those who are faithful to him and how he rewards them for their loyalty. They also show how God's blessings are extended to all people, regardless of their background or ethnicity.

The Universal Worship of God
The final section of the chapter talks about the universal worship of God. Verses 32-35 say, "Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah: To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice. Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds. O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God." These verses highlight how God is worshipped by all people and how he is the source of strength and power for his people. They also show how God's greatness is beyond measure and how he deserves to be praised and worshipped by all.

In conclusion, Psalm 68 is a beautiful and powerful chapter in the Bible that highlights God's greatness, power, and love for his people.

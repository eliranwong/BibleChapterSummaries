## Summary

Psalm 126 is a Psalm of Ascent, which means it was likely sung by Jewish pilgrims as they ascended the hill to the temple for worship. This particular Psalm focuses on the theme of restoration, both in the past and present. 

The first verse sets the tone for the rest of the Psalm, as the psalmist reflects on a past time when the Lord brought the returned exiles of Zion back to their homeland. The psalmist expresses amazement and gratitude for the restoration, comparing it to a dream. 

The verses in this chapter are structured in three distinct parts. The first part, from verse 1 to 3, is a remembrance of past deliverance. The second part, from verse 3 to 5, is a request for present renewal. The third part, from verse 5 to 6, is a series of descriptive metaphors for restoration.

There are two key verses in this chapter. The first is verse 1, which sets the context for the rest of the Psalm and emphasizes the importance of remembering past deliverance. The second key verse is verse 5, which uses a series of metaphors to describe the joy and abundance that comes with restoration.

The main theme of this chapter is restoration, both in the physical sense of the return of exiles to their homeland, and in the spiritual sense of renewal and revival. The psalmist expresses a longing for God to renew their current situation, just as he had done in the past.

To fully understand this chapter, it is important to consider the historical context. This Psalm was likely written after the Babylonian exile, when the Jews had been allowed to return to their homeland. The psalmist is likely reflecting on this time of restoration and expressing gratitude for God's faithfulness.

Scholars and religious leaders have interpreted this chapter in a variety of ways. Some see it as a call to remember God's faithfulness in the past and trust in his provision for the present. Others see it as a reminder of the importance of repentance and turning back to God in times of hardship.

There are no major controversies related to this chapter, but there is some debate over the specific historical context of the Psalm. Some scholars believe it was written during the Babylonian exile, while others believe it was written after the exile, during the time of the rebuilding of the temple.

Psalm 126 is connected thematically to other Psalms of Ascent, which all focus on the theme of journeying towards God and his presence. It is also connected to the broader theme of restoration and renewal that runs throughout the Bible.

The main lesson or moral that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of remembering God's faithfulness in the past and trusting in his provision for the present and future.

## Summary

Psalm 55 is a prayer of lament and a cry for help written by David, the psalmist. This chapter is structured in a way that shows the progression of David's emotions and thoughts as he reflects on a betrayal by a trusted friend, the corruption and deceit in the city, and the broken bond of friendship. The psalmist starts by pleading for God's attention and seeking His help in his distress.

In the introduction of the chapter, David cries out to God to listen to his prayer and not to ignore his plea. He laments in verses 2-3, expressing his anguish and fear of the enemy's oppression and the wickedness of the world. He longs to escape from the turmoil and wishes he could fly away to find rest.

The Betrayal by a Trusted Friend is the next section where David recounts the treachery of someone he trusted and shared close fellowship with. He describes how this person has turned against him, and their friendship turned into hostility. In verses 12-14, David expresses his disappointment and betrayal, saying, "For it is not an enemy who taunts me— then I could bear it; it is not an adversary who deals insolently with me— then I could hide from him. But it is you, a man, my equal, my companion, my familiar friend."

The Corruption and Deceit in the City section of the chapter describes the wickedness in the city of Jerusalem. David expresses his sorrow over the violence and deceit that has taken over the city and how its inhabitants have become corrupt. He also prays for God to judge the wickedness and bring justice to the oppressed.

The Broken Bond of Friendship section shows how David's trust in his friend has been shattered, and he feels the weight of betrayal. He acknowledges that it is not just his friend who has betrayed him but also those who have been his companions. In verse 21, he says, "His speech was smooth as butter, yet war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords." David is expressing how his friend's words did not match his actions, leading to the destruction of their relationship.

Assurance in God's Help is the next section of the chapter, where David finds comfort and reassurance in God's presence. He acknowledges that God will sustain him and not allow him to fall. David encourages himself with faith, knowing that God will hear his prayer and will sustain him in his time of need.

The False Friend's Fate and the Faithful's Resolution is the last section of the chapter. David prays for God to bring justice to the wicked, including his false friend. He also resolves to trust in God and not in human beings. In verse 22, he says, "Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved."

The main themes of Psalm 55 are betrayal, corruption, and deceit, and the assurance of God's help and faithfulness. This chapter also highlights the importance of trusting in God and relying on Him, even when those close to us fail us. It is a reminder that God is always present, and we can look to Him for help and comfort in times of distress.

The historical context of this chapter is not clear, but it is believed that David wrote this psalm during a time of great distress in his life. Some theologians interpret this psalm as a reflection of David's experience of betrayal by his son Absalom, who rebelled against him and sought to overthrow him as king.

Scholars and religious leaders interpret this chapter as an example of how to handle betrayal and deceit. It is also a reminder of the importance of seeking God's help and relying on Him in difficult times. Some controversies related to this chapter are related to the identity of the false friend and the historical context of the psalm.

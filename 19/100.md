## Summary

Psalm 100 is a psalm of thanksgiving, a call to worship the Lord with joy and gladness. The chapter is structured with four main sections, each focused on a different aspect of praising God. 

The first section, from verse 1, is a call to worship. The author calls on all the earth to shout to the Lord, to serve him with gladness and come before him with joyful singing. This is a reminder to us that praising God is not only a personal matter, but it is something that should be done in community. 

The second section, from verse 3, acknowledges God's sovereignty. The author reminds us that it is the Lord who made us, and not we ourselves. This is a reminder that we are not in control of our lives, but rather, we are subject to the will of God. 

The third section, from verse 4, is focused on entering God's presence with thanksgiving. The author encourages us to enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise. This is a reminder that we must approach God with humility and gratitude for all he has done for us. 

The fourth and final section, from verse 5, is focused on proclaiming God's goodness. The author reminds us that the Lord is good, his steadfast love endures forever, and his faithfulness continues to all generations. This is a reminder that God's goodness is not just for us, but for all generations to come. 

The main themes of Psalm 100 are worship, gratitude, and acknowledging God's sovereignty. The historical and cultural context of this psalm is likely the worship practices of ancient Israel, where psalms like this one were sung in the temple as a form of praise and thanksgiving to God. 

Theologians and scholars have interpreted Psalm 100 as a call to worship God with joy and thanksgiving, and as a reminder of our dependence on God's sovereignty in our lives. However, there are no major controversies or alternative interpretations related to this chapter. 

Psalm 100 relates to other chapters and themes in the Bible, such as Psalm 95, which also calls for joyful worship of the Lord. It also relates to the theme of gratitude and thanksgiving found throughout the Bible, such as in 1 Thessalonians 5:18, which states "give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you." 

The main lesson or moral that can be taken from Psalm 100 is the importance of worshiping God with joy and gratitude, and acknowledging his sovereignty in our lives. It reminds us that we are not in control, but that God is good and faithful, and that we can trust him in all things.

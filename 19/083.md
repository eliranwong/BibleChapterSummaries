## Summary

Psalm 83 is a prayer for God's intervention, protection, and ultimate victory over the enemies of Israel. The psalm is attributed to Asaph, one of the leaders of music in King David's court. The psalm is a song of lament, a plea for help in a time of distress, akin to many other psalms in the book of Psalms.

The first verse of the chapter sets the tone for the rest of the prayer, as Asaph cries out to God to not remain silent, to not turn a deaf ear, and to not stand aloof. Asaph's cry is one of urgency and desperation, as he pleads with God to intervene on behalf of His people.

The next section of the chapter, from verse 3, describes the unholy alliance against God's people. Asaph lists the various nations and peoples who have conspired against Israel, including the Edomites, Ishmaelites, Moabites, and others. Asaph describes the conspirators as "hidden" and "cunning," plotting behind the scenes to destroy God's people.

In verse 9, Asaph cites historical examples of divine judgment, recalling how God defeated the Midianites and Sisera's army. Asaph is reminding God of His past acts of deliverance and victory, and urging Him to act again on behalf of His people.

The prayer for vengeance and confusion begins in verse 13, as Asaph calls upon God to "make them like tumbleweed," scattered by the wind. Asaph prays for confusion and division among the enemies of Israel, asking God to "pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm."

The chapter concludes in verse 18 with a declaration of God's sovereignty and praise. Asaph acknowledges that God alone is the Most High, and that He is the only one who can save and deliver His people. Asaph ends the prayer with a call to all nations to recognize God's power and majesty.

The historical and cultural context of Psalm 83 is the ongoing conflict between Israel and its neighbors in the ancient Near East. The psalm reflects the constant threat of invasion and attack that Israel faced, and the need for divine intervention in times of crisis.

Scholars and religious leaders have interpreted Psalm 83 in various ways. Some see it as a prayer for God's protection and deliverance from enemies, while others view it as a call for divine justice and vengeance. Some see the psalm as a prophetic foreshadowing of the end times, with the enemies of Israel representing the forces of evil that will be defeated by God in the final battle.

There are no significant controversies related to Psalm 83, but some have debated the specific identities of the nations and peoples mentioned in the psalm.

Psalm 83 is connected thematically to other psalms in the book of Psalms, such as Psalm 79 and Psalm 137, which also express lament and a cry for God's intervention in times of crisis.

The main lesson or moral of Psalm 83 is the importance of trusting in God's sovereignty and power, even in the face of overwhelming opposition and danger. The psalm encourages believers to turn to God in times of trouble, to pray for His protection and deliverance, and to recognize His ultimate authority over all nations and peoples.

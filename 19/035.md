## Summary

Psalm 35 is a prayer of David to God seeking deliverance from his enemies. The chapter is structured into different sections that address different aspects of David's situation and his plea to God.

Invocation and Supplication (verses 1-3):
David begins by calling upon God to contend with those who contend with him and fight against those who fight against him. He pleads with God to take up his shield and armor and to arise to help him. David recognizes that his enemies are too strong for him to overcome on his own and that he needs God's intervention.

The Oppression and Injustice of the Enemies (verses 4-8):
David describes the oppression and injustice he has experienced at the hands of his enemies. He says they have dug a pit for him, spread a net to trap him, and set a trap for him without cause. He also accuses them of lying about him and plotting his downfall.

Trust in the Lord and Rejoicing Over Deliverance (verses 9-10):
David expresses his trust in God and his confidence that God will deliver him from his enemies. He promises to rejoice in God's salvation and to praise him for his goodness.

Debating the Unfair Treatment by Enemies (verses 11-14):
David laments the unfair treatment he has received from his enemies. He says they repay him evil for good and have become his adversaries without cause. He also reflects on how he has mourned and fasted for them, only to be met with contempt and ridicule.

The Mocking Conduct of the Enemies (verses 15-16):
David describes the mocking conduct of his enemies, who have gathered together to taunt him. They have mocked his suffering and have not shown any compassion towards him.

A Cry for God's Justice and Deliverance (verses 17-21):
David calls upon God to judge his enemies and to deliver him from their hands. He asks God to let his enemies be ashamed and confounded, and to put them to shame who rejoice at his hurt. David also asks God to vindicate him and to not let his enemies gloat over him.

Affirmation of Faith and Confidence in the Lord (verses 22-25):
David affirms his faith and confidence in God, saying that God is the judge of the righteous and the wicked. He also acknowledges that his enemies are strong, but he believes that God is stronger and can deliver him from their hands.

Thanksgiving, Praise, and Testimony to God's Deliverance (verses 26-28):
David ends the chapter with thanksgiving, praise, and testimony to God's deliverance. He promises to give thanks to God in the great congregation and to praise him among many people. David also encourages others to join him in praising God for his goodness.

Scholars and theologians see this Psalm as a reflection of the suffering of the righteous at the hands of the wicked. It is a reminder that even when we face injustice and oppression, we can turn to God for deliverance and trust in his goodness and faithfulness. The themes of injustice, trust in God, and deliverance are common throughout the Psalms and resonate with many people's experiences today.

Overall, Psalm 35 is a powerful reminder of the importance of turning to God in times of trouble and trusting in his goodness and faithfulness. It encourages us to persevere in the face of injustice and to hold onto our faith, knowing that God will deliver us in due time.

## Summary

Psalm 85 is a prayer of supplication and thanksgiving to God. The Psalmist acknowledges that God has shown favor to the land and restored the fortunes of Jacob, which is a reference to God's past faithfulness to the Israelites in delivering them from captivity and restoring them to their homeland. The Psalmist then goes on to ask for God's continued favor and restoration.

The structure of the verses in this chapter is organized around three main themes: supplication for God's favor, prayer for the restoration of God's presence, and the anticipated manifestation of God's loving-kindness.

In the first section of the chapter, the Psalmist begins by acknowledging God's past faithfulness and mercy towards the Israelites, and then asks for God's continued favor and restoration. The Psalmist pleads with God to forgive their sins and show them mercy, "Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?" (verse 6).

The second section of the chapter is a prayer for the restoration of God's presence among the people. The Psalmist longs for God to return to his people and restore their relationship with him. "Restore us again, O God of our salvation, and put away your indignation toward us!" (verse 4). The Psalmist recognizes that only God's presence can bring true joy and peace to the people, "Let me hear what God the Lord will speak, for he will speak peace to his people, to his saints; but let them not turn back to folly" (verse 8).

The final section of the chapter is focused on the anticipated manifestation of God's loving-kindness. The Psalmist proclaims that God's salvation is near and that his glory will dwell in the land. The Psalmist encourages the people to trust in God's unfailing love and mercy, "Steadfast love and faithfulness meet; righteousness and peace kiss each other" (verse 10).

The main themes or messages of this chapter are the importance of God's favor and restoration, the need for God's presence in our lives, and the assurance of God's unfailing love and mercy. The Psalmist reminds us of God's past faithfulness and encourages us to trust in his continued provision.

To understand the historical and cultural context of this chapter, it is important to note that the sons of Korah were a group of Levitical singers who served in the temple during the time of David and Solomon. The Psalmist's reference to Jacob is a reminder of God's covenant relationship with the Israelites and his promise to bless them and make them a great nation.

Scholars and theologians have interpreted this chapter as a prayer for national restoration and renewal, as well as a personal plea for forgiveness and salvation. Some have also seen this chapter as a reflection of the Israelites' experience in exile and their longing for God's presence and restoration.

There are no significant characters or symbols in this chapter, but the mention of Jacob and the land of Israel serve as reminders of God's covenant relationship with his people.

One lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of trusting in God's unfailing love and mercy, even in times of hardship and difficulty. The Psalmist's plea for restoration and forgiveness is a reminder that God is always willing to forgive and restore those who turn to him in repentance and faith.

In conclusion, Psalm 85 is a prayer of supplication and thanksgiving to God, focused on the themes of God's favor and restoration, the need for his presence, and the assurance of his unfailing love and mercy.

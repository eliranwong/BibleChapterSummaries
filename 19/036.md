## Summary

Psalm 36 is a Psalm of David, who is identified as a servant of the Lord and the author of this Psalm. The chapter is divided into four sections, each of which highlights a different aspect of the Psalm.

Introduction (verses 1-2):
David begins by declaring that his heart is burdened with an oracle of rebellion against the wicked. He points out that there is no fear of God before their eyes, indicating that they are not concerned about God's commands or His judgment.

Characteristics of the Unrighteous (verses 2-4):
David describes the unrighteous as those who flatter themselves and believe their own lies. They do not hate evil or repent of their sin. Their pride and arrogance blind them to the truth, and they do not act with wisdom or understanding.

Attributes of God (verses 5-9):
David contrasts the wickedness of the unrighteous with the righteousness of God. He describes God's love, faithfulness, righteousness, and justice. God's mercy and grace are also highlighted, as David acknowledges that it is only through God's provision that he can find true satisfaction and joy.

Prayer for God's Protection and Mercy (verses 10-11):
David concludes the Psalm with a prayer for God's protection and mercy. He asks God to continue His steadfast love and faithfulness towards those who trust in Him. He also seeks God's protection from the schemes of the wicked.

Final Proclamation (verse 12):
David ends the Psalm by proclaiming that God's righteousness and justice will prevail over the unrighteousness of the wicked. He expresses confidence that God will ultimately triumph, and that His faithful servants will find refuge in Him.

The main themes of Psalm 36 are the contrast between the unrighteousness of the wicked and the righteousness of God, and the importance of trusting in God's provision for protection and satisfaction. The historical and cultural context of this Psalm is not explicitly stated, but it is likely that David composed it during a time of personal struggle or national crisis.

Theologians, scholars, and religious leaders have interpreted Psalm 36 in various ways. Some have focused on the contrast between the wickedness of humans and the goodness of God, while others have emphasized the importance of trusting in God's protection and provision. There are no significant controversies related to this chapter.

Psalm 36 is connected to other Psalms, such as Psalm 35 and 37, which also deal with the contrast between the righteous and the wicked. It is also connected to the broader biblical theme of God's justice and righteousness.

The lesson that can be taken from Psalm 36 is the importance of recognizing the contrast between human sinfulness and God's goodness, and of placing one's trust in God's provision for protection and satisfaction.

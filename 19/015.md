## Summary

Psalm 15 is a psalm of David that focuses on the worthy dweller of God's holy mountain. David starts the psalm with a question, asking who is worthy to dwell in the presence of God, in His tent and on His holy mountain. This sets the tone for the rest of the psalm, which describes the characteristics and conduct of a worthy dweller.

The verses in this chapter are structured into four sections: an introduction to the holy dwelling, characteristics of the worthy dweller, the worthy dweller's social conduct, and a conclusion that emphasizes the unshakable assurance of the worthy dweller.

In the introduction, David emphasizes the holiness of God's dwelling and the importance of being worthy to enter it. This sets the stage for the rest of the psalm, which describes the characteristics of one who is worthy.

The characteristics of the worthy dweller, as described in verse 2, include walking blamelessly, doing what is right, and speaking truth in their heart. They do not slander or harm their neighbor, nor do they take up a reproach against their friends. They honor those who fear the Lord and keep their word even to their own hurt.

In verse 4, David describes the worthy dweller's social conduct. They do not lend money at interest or take bribes against the innocent. They stand firm against the wicked and do not compromise their values for personal gain.

The conclusion, in verse 5, emphasizes the unshakable assurance of the worthy dweller. They will never be moved, and their inheritance will never be taken away.

## Summary

Psalms 120 is one of the fifteen psalms known as "Songs of Ascents," which were likely sung by pilgrims journeying to Jerusalem for the annual feasts. The psalm's themes of distress, suffering, and seeking peace resonate with many believers' experiences today.

In the introduction, the psalmist expresses their distress and calls out to the Lord for help. The psalmist recognizes that God is the only one who can provide relief from their suffering. In verse 2, the psalmist describes their suffering, which includes dealing with lies and deceit. The psalmist's enemies are using their tongues as weapons, spreading falsehoods and causing conflict.

The psalmist then describes living among hostile people in verses 5-6. They say, "Woe to me that I dwell in Meshek, that I live among the tents of Kedar! Too long have I lived among those who hate peace." Meshek and Kedar were both regions known for their hostility towards Israel and the people of God. The psalmist feels like a stranger in their own land, surrounded by those who are against them.

Finally, in verse 7, the psalmist seeks peace in a hostile world. They say, "I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war." The psalmist desires peace, but their words are met with hostility. The psalm ends on a note of frustration and despair, with the psalmist feeling trapped in a world of conflict and deceit.

One of the key themes of Psalms 120 is the contrast between the psalmist's distress and their hope in God's deliverance. The psalmist recognizes that only God can provide relief from their suffering, and they turn to Him in prayer. Another theme is the psalmist's struggle to live among hostile people. They feel like strangers in their own land, surrounded by enemies who are spreading lies and causing conflict.

To fully understand Psalms 120, it's important to consider its historical and cultural context. The psalm was likely written during a time of conflict and political turmoil, possibly during the Babylonian exile. The psalmist's words reflect the struggles of the Jewish people during this time, as they were forced to live among those who were against them.

Scholars and theologians have interpreted Psalms 120 in various ways. Some see it as a plea for deliverance from physical enemies, while others see it as a metaphor for spiritual warfare. There is also debate about the meaning of the psalmist's reference to Meshek and Kedar, with some suggesting that these are symbolic names for the enemies of God's people.

Overall, Psalms 120 is a powerful expression of the human experience of suffering and seeking peace in a hostile world. The psalmist's words remind us that even in the midst of turmoil and conflict, we can turn to God for hope and deliverance.

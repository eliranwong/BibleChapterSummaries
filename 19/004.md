## Summary

Psalm 4 is a prayer of David, attributed to him as the author and intended to be played on stringed instruments by the choirmaster. It is a song of personal lamentation and supplication to God for relief from distress and for the assurance of God's favor to the righteous.

Introduction: Call for the Lord's Answer
In the first verse, David calls upon God to answer his prayers and acknowledges God as the God of his righteousness who has given him relief in times of distress. This sets the tone for the rest of the psalm, as David pours out his heart to God in prayer.

Warning and Admonishment to the Troublemakers
In verse 2, David addresses those who seek to harm him and warns them that their actions will not go unpunished. He admonishes them to stop their sinful ways and turn to God for forgiveness and salvation.

Assurance of God's Favor to the Righteous

The Contrast between the Faithless and the Faithful
From verse 6, David contrasts the fate of the wicked with that of the righteous. He acknowledges that the wicked have chosen to pursue their own desires rather than trusting in God, and that their end will be destruction. In contrast, the righteous can trust in the Lord and dwell in safety.

Trust in the Lord's Protection and Peace
In the final verse, David expresses his trust in the Lord's protection and peace. He acknowledges that the Lord is his shield and that he can lie down and sleep in peace, knowing that the Lord is watching over him.

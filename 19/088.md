## Summary

Psalm 88 is a prayerful lament that expresses the deep anguish and distress of Heman the Ezrahite. This psalm is attributed to the sons of Korah, who were Levites appointed to serve in the temple music ministry. The chapter is structured in a way that highlights the psalmist's appeal for help in affliction, feelings of being forsaken by God, plea for God's intervention, persistent cry for help, and suffering under God's wrath and abandonment.

The chapter begins with a plea for help in affliction, as the psalmist cries out to God day and night for salvation. The psalmist is in a state of deep distress and feels overwhelmed by his troubles. He uses the metaphor of being in the depths of Sheol, the place of the dead, to describe his despair. The psalmist feels cut off from God and unable to find solace in the midst of his affliction.

As the chapter continues, the psalmist expresses his feelings of being forsaken by God. He feels like his troubles are too great for God to handle, and that God has turned away from him. The psalmist feels like he is in a pit from which he cannot escape, and that his troubles are overwhelming and never-ending.

The psalmist pleads for God's intervention, asking God to come to his aid and save him from his troubles. He recognizes that God is the only one who can deliver him from his affliction and that without God's help, he will perish. The psalmist acknowledges that God is sovereign and powerful, and that he places his trust in God's mercy and compassion.

Despite his distress, the psalmist persists in crying out to God for help. He begs God to listen to his cries and to answer him. He recognizes that his only hope is in God's salvation, and he pleads with God to come to his aid.

The chapter concludes with the psalmist expressing his suffering under God's wrath and abandonment. He feels like God has rejected him and that his troubles are a result of God's anger. The psalmist recognizes that he is powerless to save himself and that only God can deliver him from his affliction.

The main themes of Psalm 88 are the reality of suffering, the importance of prayer, and the sovereignty of God. The psalmist recognizes that suffering is a part of life and that it can be overwhelming and never-ending. He also acknowledges the power of prayer and the importance of crying out to God in times of distress. Finally, the psalmist places his trust in the sovereignty of God, recognizing that God is in control and that he can deliver him from his affliction.

It is important to understand the historical and cultural context in which this psalm was written. The psalmist was likely facing some sort of physical or emotional affliction and was crying out to God for help. The psalmist was also likely familiar with the temple music ministry and would have been familiar with the role that music played in worship and prayer.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted Psalm 88 in various ways. Some see it as a prayer of hopelessness and despair, while others see it as a prayer of faith and trust in God. Some have also interpreted the psalm as a prophetic foreshadowing of Christ's descent into hell.

There are no significant controversies related to Psalm 88, but it is a powerful reminder of the reality of suffering and the importance of prayer in times of distress. It also reminds us of the sovereignty of God and the power of his mercy and compassion.

Psalm 88 relates to other chapters and themes in the Bible that deal with suffering and prayer. It echoes the cries of other psalmists, such as David, who also cried out to God in times of distress. It also foreshadows the suffering and death of Christ, who cried out to God on the cross.

Invocation and Lament (verses 1-4): The Psalm begins with an invocation to God, asking Him to hear David's prayer and pleas for mercy. David acknowledges that God is faithful and righteous and pleads with Him not to judge him according to his own righteousness but to show him mercy. David describes his current situation as being in the darkness, with his enemies pursuing him and crushing him to the ground. He feels overwhelmed and helpless, and he turns to God for help.

Meditation on God's Past Acts and the Psalmist's Thirst for God (verses 5-6): In this section, David reflects on God's past deeds and how they give him hope. He remembers how God helped him in the past and how he has seen God's power and glory. David longs for God's presence and thirsts for Him like a parched land. He believes that if he can just be in God's presence, his spirit will be renewed, and he will have the strength to face his enemies.

Petitions for Deliverance and Guidance (verses 7-10): David begins this section by asking God to answer him quickly and not to hide His face from him. He then asks for God's guidance and direction, acknowledging that he is God's servant and that he trusts in Him. David also prays for protection from his enemies, asking God to lead him on level ground and to teach him to do His will.

Prayer for the Preservation of Life and the Defeat of Enemies (verses 11-12): In the final section, David asks God to preserve his life for His name's sake and to bring his soul out of trouble. He prays for the destruction of his enemies and for God's mercy and righteousness to be shown to him. David ends the Psalm by declaring that he is God's servant and asking Him to give him His Spirit.

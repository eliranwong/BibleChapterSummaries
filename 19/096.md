The psalm is structured into five parts, each highlighting a different aspect of God's greatness and calling on all people to worship him.

Call to Worship the Lord:
The first part of Psalm 96 begins with a call to worship the Lord. The psalmist commands all people to sing a new song to the Lord, declaring his salvation and his glory. The psalmist encourages all people to bring offerings and to bow down before the Lord in worship.

The Supreme Glory of the Lord:
The second part of the psalm emphasizes the greatness and majesty of the Lord. The psalmist describes the Lord as "greatly to be praised" and "awesome above all gods." The psalmist also emphasizes that the Lord is the creator of all things, the one who made the heavens and the earth.

Nations Invited to Pay Honors to the Lord:
In the third part of the psalm, the psalmist calls on all nations to pay homage to the Lord. The psalmist emphasizes that the Lord is the ruler of all nations and that all people should praise him for his justice, faithfulness, and righteousness.

Proclaim the Lord's Reign:
In the fourth part of the psalm, the psalmist calls on all creation to join in proclaiming the Lord's reign. The psalmist encourages all people to rejoice and to sing for joy because the Lord is coming to judge the earth with righteousness and truth.

The Coming of the Lord in Judgment:
The final part of the psalm emphasizes the coming of the Lord in judgment. The psalmist warns that the Lord is coming to judge the earth and to right all wrongs. The psalmist encourages all people to prepare for the Lord's coming by living in righteousness and by worshiping him with fear and reverence.

The main theme of Psalm 96 is the call to worship the Lord and to declare his greatness to all nations. The psalm emphasizes the Lord's sovereignty, his majesty, and his righteousness. It also warns of the Lord's coming in judgment and encourages all people to prepare for his coming by living in righteousness and by worshiping him with fear and reverence.

The historical and cultural context of the psalm is important to understand its message. The psalm was likely written during the period of the Jewish exile in Babylon, when the Israelites were separated from their homeland and their temple. The psalmist encourages the people to continue to worship the Lord even in a foreign land and to proclaim his greatness to all nations.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted Psalm 96 in various ways. Some see the psalm as a call to evangelism, encouraging all people to share the good news of the Lord's salvation with others. Others see the psalm as a call to social justice, emphasizing the Lord's concern for the oppressed and the marginalized.

There are no significant controversies related to Psalm 96, but it is a popular psalm used in Christian worship services. The psalm has inspired many hymns and songs, and its message of worshiping the Lord with joy and thanksgiving continues to resonate with people today.

Psalm 96 is also connected to other chapters and themes in the Bible. It shares similarities with other psalms that call for the worship of the Lord, such as Psalm 98 and Psalm 100. It also connects to the theme of God's sovereignty and judgment that is found throughout the Bible, particularly in the prophetic books.

The lesson that can be taken from Psalm 96 is the importance of worshiping the Lord with joy and thanksgiving, regardless of our circumstances. The psalm encourages us to declare the greatness of the Lord to all nations and to prepare for his coming in judgment by living in righteousness and by worshiping him with fear and reverence.

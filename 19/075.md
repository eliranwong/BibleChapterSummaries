## Summary

Psalm 75 is a psalm of thanksgiving and praise to God. The psalmist, Asaph, begins by acknowledging God's greatness and wondrous deeds. He declares, "We give thanks to You, O God, we give thanks, And Your name is near; Your wondrous deeds are recounted" (verse 1). Asaph highlights the nearness of God's name, which indicates the closeness of His presence and power.

The psalm then turns to a warning against boasting and arrogance. Asaph declares that God is the one who judges and exalts. He says, "For not from the east or from the west And not from the desert comes exaltation; But God is the Judge; He puts down one and exalts another" (verses 6-7). Asaph reminds the readers that it is not by their own strength or power that they succeed, but by God's grace.

In verse 8, Asaph speaks directly to the wicked and arrogant. He warns them that they will be brought down by God's judgment. He says, "For a cup is in the hand of the Lord, and the wine foams; It is well mixed, and He pours out of this; Surely all the wicked of the earth must drain and drink down its dregs."

The psalm ends with a resolute commitment to praise and trust in God. Asaph declares, "But as for me, I will declare it forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. And I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, But the horns of the righteous will be lifted up" (verses 9-10).

## Summary

Psalm 124 is a song of ascent written by David. This psalm is believed to have been used by the Israelites as they traveled to Jerusalem for their annual festivals. The psalm is divided into four parts: an introduction, a section about the Lord as Israel's protector, gratitude for divine deliverance, and a conclusion about the Israelites' dependence on the Lord.

The introduction in verse 1 sets the tone for the psalm. It acknowledges that if it had not been for the Lord's protection, Israel would not have survived their many enemies. This verse is a call to worship, inviting the Israelites to praise the Lord for his protection.

The second section, beginning in verse 2, describes the Lord's role as Israel's protector. The imagery used here is of wild animals attacking their prey. The Lord is portrayed as a hunter who has snatched Israel from the jaws of death. The psalmist acknowledges that if the Lord had not been on their side, the enemies would have swallowed them alive.

In verse 4, the psalmist uses the metaphor of a flood to describe the enemy's attack. The metaphor emphasizes the overwhelming force of the enemy, which would have swept Israel away. However, in verse 5, the psalmist acknowledges that the Lord has protected them from the flood. The floodwaters have not overwhelmed them because the Lord has been their refuge.

In the following section, beginning in verse 6, the psalmist expresses gratitude for the Lord's divine deliverance. The psalmist declares that the Lord has helped them escape from their enemies' traps. The snare has been broken, and they have been set free.

Finally, in verse 8, the psalm concludes by emphasizing the Israelites' dependence on the Lord. The psalmist acknowledges that their help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. The psalmist declares that the Lord is their protector and will continue to protect them forevermore.

The main theme of Psalm 124 is the Lord's protection of Israel. The psalmist acknowledges that without the Lord's protection, Israel would have been destroyed by their enemies. The psalmist's gratitude for divine deliverance emphasizes the importance of trusting in the Lord and seeking his protection in times of trouble.

To fully understand the meaning of Psalm 124, it is important to consider the historical and cultural context in which it was written. The Israelites were a small nation surrounded by powerful enemies. The psalm reflects the Israelites' dependence on the Lord for protection in the face of overwhelming odds.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted Psalm 124 in various ways. Some see it as a call to worship and praise the Lord for his protection.

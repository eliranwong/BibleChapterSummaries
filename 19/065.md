The chapter is structured into three parts, each highlighting a different aspect of God's character and nature. The first part of the chapter focuses on God's righteousness and the need to praise Him. The second part of the chapter talks about God's power in creation, while the third part emphasizes God's provision and care for the earth.

In the first part of the chapter, the psalmist exclaims, "Blessed is the one you choose and bring near, to dwell in your courts! We shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house, the holiness of your temple" (v. 4).

In the second part of the chapter, the psalmist reflects on God's power in creation. "By awesome deeds you answer us with righteousness, O God of our salvation, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas" (v. 5). The psalmist recognizes that God has power over the seas and the mountains, and His power is evident in the changing of the seasons.

In the third part of the chapter, the psalmist speaks of God's provision and care for the earth. "You visit the earth and water it; you greatly enrich it; the river of God is full of water; you provide their grain, for so you have prepared it" (v. 9). The psalmist acknowledges that God provides for His people and takes care of the earth. The psalmist also recognizes that God's provision brings joy and abundance to the people.

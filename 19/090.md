## Summary

Psalm 90 is a prayer attributed to Moses, the man of God. This chapter is a reflection on the eternal nature of God and the transience of human life. The psalmist starts by acknowledging God as the eternal refuge, who has been the dwelling place for all generations. This is a recognition of God's role as the protector and provider of His people.

The verses in this chapter are structured around four subheadings. The first subheading, from verse 1, introduces the chapter and acknowledges God as the eternal refuge. The second subheading, from verse 3, contrasts the eternity of God with the transience of human life. It emphasizes the fleeting nature of human life and the fact that all people will ultimately return to the dust of the earth.

The third subheading, from verse 7, recognizes the reality of human suffering and sin. It acknowledges that human life is filled with hardship and that people are prone to sin. The psalmist asks God to help His people understand the brevity of their existence and to teach them to use their time wisely.

The fourth subheading, from verse 12, is a prayer for wisdom, compassion, and God's favor. The psalmist asks God to give His people a heart of wisdom and to make them glad for as many days as they have been afflicted. He also asks God to show His favor to His people and to establish the work of their hands.

One of the key verses in this chapter is verse 10, which reads, "The days of our lives are seventy years; And if by reason of strength they are eighty years, Yet their boast is only labor and sorrow; For it is soon cut off, and we fly away." This verse emphasizes the brevity of human life and the fact that our time on earth is limited.

Another significant character in this chapter is Moses, who is credited with writing this prayer. Moses was a prominent figure in the Old Testament and is known for leading the Israelites out of Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments from God.

The main themes of this chapter include the eternal nature of God, the transience of human life, the reality of human suffering and sin, and the need for wisdom and compassion. It emphasizes the importance of acknowledging God's sovereignty and seeking His guidance in all things.

To fully understand this chapter, it is important to consider the historical and cultural context of the Israelites during Moses' time. They were a people who had been enslaved in Egypt for generations and were looking to God for deliverance. This prayer reflects their dependence on God and their recognition of His power and authority.

Theologians, scholars, and religious leaders have interpreted this chapter in various ways. Some see it as a reflection on the brevity of life and the need to use our time on earth wisely, while others see it as a call to trust in God's sovereignty and seek His guidance in all things.

There are no significant controversies or popular interpretations related to this chapter. However, it is often used in funeral services to reflect on the brevity of life and the hope of eternal life with God.

Psalm 90 relates to other chapters and themes in the Bible, particularly those that emphasize the sovereignty of God and the importance of seeking His guidance. It also relates to themes of wisdom, compassion, and the brevity of life found in other books, such as Proverbs and Ecclesiastes.

The main lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of acknowledging God's sovereignty and seeking His guidance in all things. It reminds us that our time on earth is limited and that we should use our time wisely to glorify God and serve others.

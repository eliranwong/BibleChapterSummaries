## Summary

Jude 1 is a short but powerful letter written by Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James. The letter is addressed to "those who are loved by God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ, called" (v.1), indicating that its audience includes believers in Christ. The chapter can be divided into several sections based on its content.

Greeting (vv.1-2)
Jude begins his letter by introducing himself and his intended audience. He refers to himself as a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, likely the James who was a leader in the early Christian church (Acts 15:13). Jude offers a brief prayer for his readers, asking that they receive mercy, peace, and love from God.

Call to Contend for the Faith (vv.3-4)
In the next section, Jude makes a passionate appeal to his readers to "contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God's holy people" (v.3). He warns them that false teachers have infiltrated their community and are perverting the gospel of Christ. These false teachers deny Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior and engage in immoral behavior. Jude reminds his readers that God has judged those who rebelled against him in the past and will do so again.

Reminders of God's Judgment (vv.5-7)
Jude uses three examples from the Hebrew Bible to remind his readers of God's judgment on those who rebel against him: the Israelites who were rescued from Egypt but later rebelled and were destroyed in the wilderness (v.5); the angels who sinned and were cast into darkness (v.6); and the residents of Sodom and Gomorrah who engaged in sexual immorality and were destroyed by fire (v.7). These examples serve to reinforce the seriousness of the false teachers' sin and the judgment that awaits them.

Indictment of the False Teachers (vv.8-13)
Jude goes on to describe the false teachers in detail, using strong language to condemn their behavior. He accuses them of rejecting authority, slandering celestial beings, and following their own corrupt desires. He compares them to Cain, Balaam, and Korah, all of whom rebelled against God's authority and suffered judgment.

Enoch's Prophecy (vv.14-15)
Jude quotes from the Book of Enoch, an apocryphal Jewish text, to reinforce his warning of judgment for the false teachers. He cites Enoch's prophecy that the Lord will come with thousands of his holy ones to judge the ungodly and convict all of their ungodly acts.

Description of the False Teachers (vv.16-19)
Jude continues his condemnation of the false teachers, describing them as grumblers, fault-finders, and boastful. He characterizes them as worldly people who do not have the Spirit.

Exhortation to Build Up and Persevere (vv.20-23)
In the final section of the chapter, Jude encourages his readers to build themselves up in their faith and to pray in the Holy Spirit. He urges them to show mercy to those who doubt and to save others by snatching them from the fire. He concludes by warning them to be careful not to be contaminated by the false teachers' sin.

Doxology: Praise to God (v.24-25)
Jude ends his letter with a powerful doxology, praising God who is able to keep his people from stumbling and to present them before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy. He attributes all glory, majesty, power, and authority to God through Jesus Christ.

In conclusion, Jude 1 is a letter that calls believers to contend for the faith and warns them of the dangers of false teachers who have infiltrated their community. It reminds readers of God's judgment on those who rebel against him and encourages them to persevere in their faith. The chapter ends with a doxology that praises God for his power and ability to preserve his people.

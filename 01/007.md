## Summary

Genesis 7 is a pivotal chapter in the Book of Genesis, as it marks the beginning of the flood narrative. In this chapter, we see God's divine judgment upon the sinful world, and his saving grace towards Noah and his family.

Entering the ark:
The chapter begins with God commanding Noah to enter the ark with his family and animals, as the flood was about to come. This was because Noah was found righteous before God, and therefore, was chosen to be the one to preserve the human race and animal species from extinction. This verse emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's commands, as Noah and his family's lives were spared because of their obedience.

The onset of the flood:
In verse 11, we see that the flood begins, as the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. This verse highlights the destructive power of God's judgment, which was not only limited to rainfall but also involved the breaking up of the earth's surface. This shows that God's judgment is not to be taken lightly, and disobedience leads to severe consequences.

The destruction of life on earth:
The rest of the chapter details the destruction of all life on earth, except for those in the ark. The flood waters covered the earth for 150 days, illustrating the thoroughness of God's judgment. This emphasizes the severity of sin and the need for repentance, as well as the power of God to save those who are obedient and faithful.

Key verses:
One of the key verses in this chapter is verse 16, which states that "the Lord shut him in." This verse shows God's sovereignty and control over the situation.

This verse also emphasizes the importance of trusting in God's plans and protection, even in the midst of difficult circumstances.

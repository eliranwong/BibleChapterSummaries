## Summary

Genesis 38 is a story about Judah and his family. The chapter opens with Judah leaving his brothers and settling in Adullam. There, he married a Canaanite woman named Shua, and they had three sons: Er, Onan, and Shelah.

The first part of the chapter focuses on the story of Judah's son, Er. Er marries a woman named Tamar, but he is wicked in the sight of the Lord, and God puts him to death. Following the custom of the time, Judah instructs his second son, Onan, to marry Tamar and father a child in Er's name. However, Onan is also wicked and refuses to fulfill his duty, so God puts him to death as well.

After the death of both Er and Onan, Judah is afraid to give his third son, Shelah, to Tamar as a husband, fearing he too would die. So, Judah sends Tamar back to her father's house, promising to give Shelah to her when he is older. However, as time passes, Judah does not fulfill his promise, and Tamar remains a widow.

Desperate for a child, Tamar takes matters into her own hands. She disguises herself as a prostitute and waits for Judah on the road to Timnah. When Judah sees her, he does not recognize her and propositions her. Tamar agrees to sleep with him but asks for his signet, cord, and staff as collateral. After they sleep together, Tamar becomes pregnant.

Later, Judah discovers that Tamar is pregnant, and he orders her to be burned because he thinks she has been unfaithful. However, Tamar shows him the items he gave her as collateral and proves that he is the father of her child. Judah acknowledges his wrongdoing and admits that Tamar is more righteous than he is.

The key verse in this chapter is Genesis 38:26, where Judah says, "She is more righteous than I since I wouldn't give her to my son Shelah." This verse highlights the theme of righteousness and the consequences of not fulfilling one's promises.

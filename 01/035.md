## Summary

Genesis 35 is a significant chapter in the Bible that covers important events in the life of Jacob and his family. This chapter is divided into two main sections: Jacob's journey to Bethel and God's reaffirmation of the covenant, and the death of Rachel and Isaac.

The chapter begins with God instructing Jacob to go to Bethel, where he had previously had a vision of a ladder reaching to heaven. God tells Jacob to build an altar to the God who had appeared to him when he fled from his brother Esau. Jacob obeyed God's command and journeyed with his entire household to Bethel. Along the way, Jacob buried the idols and foreign gods that his family had acquired, signifying a turning point in his family's devotion to God.

Upon arrival in Bethel, Jacob built an altar and named the place El Bethel, meaning "God of Bethel." God appeared to Jacob and reaffirmed the covenant He had made with him and his forefathers, promising him land, descendants, and blessings. God also changed Jacob's name to Israel, which means "he who struggles with God."

The second section of the chapter begins with the birth of Benjamin, Rachel's second son. Tragically, Rachel died giving birth to Benjamin and was buried on the way to Ephrath. Jacob mourned her death deeply.

The chapter ends with the death of Isaac, Abraham's son and Jacob's father. Jacob and Esau come together to bury their father in the cave of Machpelah, where Abraham and Sarah were also buried.

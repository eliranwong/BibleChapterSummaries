## Summary

Genesis 44 is a continuation of the story of Joseph and his brothers. In this chapter, Joseph sets up a plan to test his brothers' character and see if they have truly changed from their past ways.

The chapter begins with Joseph commanding the steward of his house to fill his brothers' sacks with as much food as they can carry and to place each man's money in the mouth of his sack. This is done without the knowledge of Joseph's brothers.

As Joseph's brothers leave Egypt, the steward catches up to them and accuses them of stealing the silver cup that was placed in Benjamin's sack. The brothers deny any knowledge of the cup and offer to be searched. The steward finds the cup in Benjamin's sack and the brothers are brought back to Joseph's house.

Joseph accuses them of stealing and threatens to keep Benjamin as his slave. Judah steps forward and pleads with Joseph to take him as a slave instead, offering himself in place of Benjamin. Judah recounts the events of their past, including the loss of their brother Joseph, and begs for mercy.

Joseph is moved by Judah's plea and reveals his true identity to his brothers. He forgives them and sends them back to their father with gifts and provisions.

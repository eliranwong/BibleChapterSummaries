## Summary

Daniel 5 is a chapter in the book of Daniel, which tells the story of King Belshazzar's sacrilegious feast and the mysterious handwriting on the wall that appeared during the feast. This chapter is structured chronologically, with each section revealing a different part of the story.

The first section, from verse 1, introduces King Belshazzar and his feast, which he hosted for a thousand of his nobles. During the feast, Belshazzar drank wine and commanded that the gold and silver vessels taken from the temple in Jerusalem be brought out so he and his guests could drink from them. This was a sacrilegious act, as the vessels were meant to be used for worship in the temple and not for profane purposes.

In the second section, from verse 5, a mysterious handwriting appeared on the wall of the banquet hall, which terrified Belshazzar and his guests. The writing was in an unknown language and none of the wise men or astrologers in the kingdom could interpret it.

The third section, from verse 10, introduces Daniel, who was brought before Belshazzar to interpret the handwriting. Daniel reminded Belshazzar of his grandfather Nebuchadnezzar's downfall due to his pride and arrogance, and then interpreted the writing on the wall. The words "MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN" meant that Belshazzar's days were numbered, his kingdom would be divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.

In the final section, from verse 29, Belshazzar was killed that very night and the kingdom was given to Darius the Mede. This chapter concludes with the fall of Belshazzar and the rise of Darius.

The main themes of this chapter include the consequences of sacrilege, the importance of heedfulness, and the sovereignty of God. Belshazzar's sacrilegious act of drinking from the holy vessels led to his downfall and the loss of his kingdom. The handwriting on the wall was a warning to Belshazzar to turn from his sinful ways and seek forgiveness, but he did not heed the warning and suffered the consequences. Ultimately, God is in control of all things, and the rise and fall of kingdoms are in His hands.

To understand the historical and cultural context of this chapter, it is important to note that it takes place during the Babylonian exile of the Israelites. The Babylonians had conquered the Israelites and taken them into captivity, and Belshazzar was ruling over Babylon at this time. The writing on the wall was a message from God to Belshazzar, warning him of the consequences of his sinful actions.

Theologians and scholars interpret this chapter as a warning against pride and arrogance, and a reminder of the sovereignty of God. Belshazzar's pride and sacrilege brought about his downfall, and God's warning through the handwriting on the wall shows that He is in control of all things.

There are no significant controversies related to this chapter, but some interpretations suggest that the writing on the wall was in Aramaic, which was a common language in Babylon at the time.

This chapter relates to other chapters in the book of Daniel, which also focus on the sovereignty of God and the consequences of disobedience. It also relates to other books in the Bible, such as Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, which also warn against pride and the consequences of sinful actions.

The lessons and morals that can be taken from this chapter include the importance of respect for holy things, the consequences of pride and arrogance, the power of God's warnings, and the need for heedfulness and repentance.

## Summary

Matthew 21 begins with Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem. He sent two disciples ahead to get a donkey and a colt for him to ride on. As Jesus rode into Jerusalem, crowds of people spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from trees and laid them on the road. The people shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!" (Matthew 21:9). This fulfilled the prophecy in Zechariah 9:9, which said that the Messiah would come riding on a donkey.

In verse 12, Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. Jesus declared, "My house will be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of robbers" (Matthew 21:13).

In verses 18-22, Jesus cursed a fig tree that had no fruit on it. The fig tree withered immediately, and Jesus used this as an opportunity to teach his disciples about the power of faith.

From verse 23, Jesus' authority is questioned by the chief priests and elders of the people. They asked him by what authority he was doing these things and who gave him this authority. Jesus responded by asking them about John the Baptist's baptism and whether it was from God or man. The religious leaders were unable to answer Jesus' question and so he refused to answer theirs.

In verses 28-46, Jesus told three parables: the parable of the two sons, the parable of the tenants, and the parable of the wedding feast. These parables were meant to teach the religious leaders about repentance, God's judgement, and the importance of accepting Jesus as the Messiah.

The main themes of Matthew 21 are Jesus' authority, his role as the Messiah, and the importance of faith and repentance. The historical and cultural context is important to understand the significance of Jesus riding on a donkey, which was a symbol of humility and peace. The cleansing of the temple was also significant because it showed that Jesus was taking a stand against the corruption and greed of the religious leaders.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter as a demonstration of Jesus' power and authority, as well as his willingness to confront religious hypocrisy and corruption. Some have also seen the parables as a warning to those who reject Jesus and the consequences of not following him.

There are controversies related to this chapter, particularly regarding Jesus' actions in the temple and the cursing of the fig tree. Some have criticized Jesus' use of violence in the temple, while others see it as a necessary action to restore the temple's holy purpose.

Matthew 21 relates to other chapters in the Bible, particularly the prophecies in the Old Testament about the Messiah's coming and his role as a savior. The parables also connect to Jesus' teachings about the Kingdom of God and his call for repentance and faith.

The lessons that can be taken from Matthew 21 include the importance of recognizing Jesus as the Messiah and accepting his authority, the need for repentance and faith in God, and the dangers of religious hypocrisy and corruption.

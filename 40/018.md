## Subheadings

* From verse 1 - Teachings on Humility and Discipline

## Summary

Matthew 18 is a chapter in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The chapter begins with the disciples asking Jesus who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Jesus uses this opportunity to teach his disciples about humility and discipline.

The chapter is structured around three main teachings: humility and discipline (verses 1-14), dealing with sin in the church (verses 15-20), and forgiveness (verses 21-35).

In the first section, Jesus teaches his disciples about the importance of humility and warns them against causing others to stumble. He says, "Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven" (verse 4). He also warns against causing others to sin, saying, "If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea" (verse 6).

Jesus then goes on to teach about discipline in the church. He says that if a fellow believer sins against you, you should go and point out their fault privately. If they refuse to listen, then bring one or two others with you as witnesses. If they still refuse to listen, then bring the matter before the church. If they still refuse to repent, then they should be treated as a pagan or a tax collector (verses 15-17).

In the final section of the chapter, Jesus teaches about forgiveness. Peter asks Jesus how many times he should forgive his brother who sins against him. Jesus responds, "not seven times, but seventy-seven times" (verse 22). He then tells the parable of the unmerciful servant, in which a servant who was forgiven a huge debt refuses to forgive a fellow servant who owes him a much smaller debt. Jesus concludes the parable by saying, "This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart" (verse 35).

There are several key verses in this chapter, including verse 4, which teaches about the importance of humility, and verse 22, which teaches about the need for unlimited forgiveness.

The chapter also contains several significant characters, including the disciples who ask Jesus about greatness in the kingdom of heaven, and the unmerciful servant in the parable.

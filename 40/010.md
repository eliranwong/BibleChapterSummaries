## Subheadings

* From verse 1 - Sending Out the Twelve

## Summary

Matthew 10 is a chapter in the New Testament of the Bible that records the instructions and commissioning given by Jesus Christ to his twelve apostles before sending them out to proclaim the good news of the kingdom of heaven to the people of Israel. 

Sending Out the Twelve
The chapter begins with Jesus summoning his twelve disciples and giving them the authority to heal diseases and cast out unclean spirits. He then instructs them to go only to the lost sheep of Israel, rather than to the Gentiles or Samaritans. They are to proclaim the message that the kingdom of heaven is near, and to perform miraculous signs as evidence of their authority.

Persecutions Foretold
Jesus warns his disciples that they will face opposition and persecution, and that they must be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. He tells them that they will be handed over to the authorities and flogged in synagogues, and that they will be brought before governors and kings for his sake. However, he assures them that they will be given the words to speak by the Holy Spirit, and that those who endure to the end will be saved.

Not Peace, but a Sword
Jesus tells his disciples that their message will cause division and strife even within families, as some will accept it and others will reject it. He says that he has not come to bring peace but a sword, and that those who love their families more than him are not worthy of him.

Take Up Your Cross
Jesus tells his disciples that whoever does not take up their cross and follow him is not worthy of him. He says that whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for his sake will find it.

Rewards for Service
Jesus promises his disciples that whoever receives them receives him, and whoever receives him receives the one who sent him. He also promises that whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of his disciples because they are his followers will not lose their reward.

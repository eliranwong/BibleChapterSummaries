## Summary

Matthew 28 is the final chapter of the Gospel of Matthew and tells the story of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The chapter begins with the women who had been followers of Jesus coming to visit his tomb, only to find it empty. An angel appears to them and tells them that Jesus has risen from the dead. 

The first section of the chapter, from verse 11, tells the story of the guards who had been stationed at the tomb. They had been given orders to make sure that no one stole Jesus' body, but when the women arrive and tell them that Jesus has risen, they become frightened and report the news to the chief priests. The chief priests bribe the guards to keep quiet about what happened, telling them to say that the disciples had stolen the body while they were sleeping.

The second section of the chapter, from verse 16, tells the story of the Great Commission. Jesus appears to his disciples and tells them to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. He promises to be with them always, even to the end of the age. 

The verses in this chapter are structured in a narrative form, with the story of the women at the tomb, the guards, and the Great Commission all presented in chronological order. 

Key verses in this chapter include verse 6, where the angel tells the women, "He is not here; he has risen, just as he said"; verse 18, where Jesus says to his disciples, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me"; and verse 20, where Jesus promises to be with his disciples always. 

The main theme of this chapter is the resurrection of Jesus and the fulfillment of his promise to his followers. It also emphasizes the importance of spreading the gospel message to all people and nations. 

To fully understand this chapter, it is important to have knowledge of the historical and cultural context of the time period. During this time, the Roman Empire was in power and Jewish leaders had a complex relationship with the occupying forces. Additionally, the disciples were facing persecution and opposition as they spread the message of Jesus. 

Theologians and religious leaders have interpreted this chapter in a variety of ways. Many see it as a confirmation of the divinity of Jesus and his power over death. Others see it as a call to evangelism and spreading the gospel message to the world. 

One popular interpretation of this chapter is the controversy surrounding the guards at the tomb. Some argue that the guards' report is evidence of the truth of the resurrection, while others believe that it was a fabrication by the chief priests to discredit the followers of Jesus. 

Matthew 28 also relates to other chapters and themes in the Bible, particularly the prophecies of the Old Testament regarding the coming of a Messiah who would save his people. It also connects to the theme of salvation through belief in Jesus Christ and the importance of spreading the gospel message. 

The lesson or moral of this chapter is that Jesus has risen from the dead and is alive, and that his followers are called to spread the message of his resurrection and salvation to the world. It also teaches the importance of faith in Jesus and the promise of eternal life for those who believe.

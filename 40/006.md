## Summary

Matthew 6 is a chapter that contains some of the most well-known teachings of Jesus, including the Lord's Prayer and the instruction to "seek first the kingdom of God." The chapter can be divided into three main sections, each with its own theme and message.

Motives in Giving, Praying, and Fasting (verses 1-18):
Jesus begins this section by warning his listeners not to perform acts of righteousness simply to be seen by others. He says that if they do, they will have no reward from God. Instead, Jesus encourages his followers to give to the needy, pray, and fast in secret, so that only God will see and reward them.

Jesus also teaches his followers how to pray, giving them the Lord's Prayer as a model. He emphasizes the importance of forgiveness, saying that if we do not forgive others, God will not forgive us.

Finally, Jesus speaks about fasting, saying that it should be done in secret and not for show. He reminds his listeners that God sees what is done in secret and will reward them accordingly.

Treasures in Heaven (verses 19-24):
In this section, Jesus warns his followers not to store up treasures on earth, where they can be destroyed or stolen. Instead, he tells them to store up treasures in heaven, where they will last forever.

Jesus says that where our treasure is, there our heart will be also. He warns that we cannot serve both God and money, and that we must choose to serve one or the other.

Do Not Worry (verses 25-34):
In the final section of the chapter, Jesus teaches his followers not to worry about their lives, what they will eat or drink or wear. He reminds them that God takes care of the birds of the air and the flowers of the field, and that they are much more valuable than these.

Jesus says that worrying cannot add a single hour to our lives, and that we should instead seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. He promises that if we do, God will provide for all of our needs.

Throughout the chapter, Jesus emphasizes the importance of having the right motives and priorities in our relationship with God. He teaches that true righteousness is not about outward appearances or actions, but about what is in our hearts. He encourages his followers to seek first the kingdom of God and trust that God will take care of their needs.

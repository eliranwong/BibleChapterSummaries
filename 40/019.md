## Summary

Matthew 19 is a chapter in the New Testament of the Bible that contains three distinct stories of Jesus' teachings and interactions with people. These stories cover the topics of divorce and remarriage, Jesus blessing the children, and the encounter with the rich young man. Each of these stories has its own unique message and meaning.

Divorce and Remarriage (verses 1-12)
The chapter begins with Jesus leaving Galilee and traveling to the region of Judea. Here, the Pharisees approached him with a question about divorce. They asked if it was lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason. Jesus responded by saying that in the beginning, God created them male and female, and that a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. He then went on to say that what God has joined together, let no man separate.

The Pharisees then asked why Moses allowed divorce if it was not God's original plan. Jesus responded by saying that it was because of the hardness of their hearts that Moses allowed divorce, but from the beginning, it was not so. He then stated that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.

Jesus' words on divorce and remarriage are often used to argue against divorce and remarriage, but it is important to note that Jesus' main message here is the importance of the marriage covenant and the permanence of the union. He emphasizes that marriage is a holy union created by God, and divorce should not be taken lightly.

Jesus Blesses the Children (verses 13-15)
The next section of the chapter focuses on Jesus' interaction with children. People brought their children to Jesus so that he could bless them, but the disciples rebuked them. Jesus then says, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." He then laid his hands on the children and blessed them.

This story emphasizes the importance of childlike faith and the value of children in the eyes of God. Jesus' words also reveal that the kingdom of heaven is not just for the powerful or the elite, but for all who come to him with childlike faith.

The Rich Young Man (verses 16-30)
The final section of the chapter tells the story of a rich young man who approaches Jesus and asks what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus tells him to keep the commandments, to which the young man responds that he has already done so. Jesus then tells him that if he wants to be perfect, he must sell all his possessions, give to the poor, and follow him.

This story highlights the difficulty of letting go of material possessions and following Jesus wholeheartedly. The rich young man was willing to follow the commandments but was unwilling to give up his wealth. Jesus' words also show that eternal life is not earned through following the law but comes through complete surrender to him.

In conclusion, Matthew 19 covers a range of topics, from divorce and remarriage to the value of children and the importance of following Jesus wholeheartedly. Each story reveals a different aspect of Jesus' teachings and character, and they all provide valuable lessons for believers today. Understanding the historical and cultural context of these stories helps us to better understand the messages and meanings behind them. Overall, this chapter emphasizes the importance of faith, commitment, and surrender to Jesus.

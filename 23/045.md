## Subheadings

* From verse 1 - Cyrus the Lord's Shepherd and Jerusalem's Restoration

## Summary

Isaiah 45 is a prophetic chapter that speaks about Cyrus, the Persian king, who was not a follower of Yahweh, but was chosen by God to deliver Israel from Babylonian captivity and to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. The chapter also emphasizes the sovereignty of God, His power to control history, and the importance of acknowledging Him as the one true God.

The chapter is structured around two main sections: the first section focuses on Cyrus as the Lord's shepherd, while the second section describes Jerusalem's restoration.

In the first section, starting from verse 1, the Lord speaks to Cyrus, calling him His anointed one and declaring that He has taken him by his right hand to subdue nations and to open doors before him. This is significant because it shows that God is in control of history, and He can use anyone, even a non-believer, to achieve His purposes. The Lord also promises Cyrus that He will go before him and make the rough places smooth, break down the gates of bronze, and cut through the bars of iron. This means that God will provide for Cyrus and make his path smooth and clear.

In the second section, starting from verse 8, the Lord emphasizes His sovereignty and power over all things. He declares that He is the one true God, and there is no other. He is the creator of everything, and He controls everything. The Lord also reminds Israel that they are His chosen people, and He will protect and deliver them. He calls on them to turn to Him and be saved, for there is no other God besides Him.

One of the key verses in the chapter is verse 5, where the Lord declares, "I am the Lord, and there is no other; apart from me there is no God. I will strengthen you, though you have not acknowledged me." This verse emphasizes the sovereignty of God and the importance of acknowledging Him as the one true God. It also shows that God is willing to help anyone who turns to Him, even if they do not acknowledge Him.

The significant characters in the chapter are Cyrus, the Persian king, and the Israelites, whom God chose as His people. The events described in the chapter include God's declaration of Cyrus as His anointed one, His promise to go before him and make his path smooth, and His call on Israel to turn to Him and be saved.

The main themes of the chapter are the sovereignty of God, His power to control history, and the importance of acknowledging Him as the one true God. The chapter also emphasizes God's faithfulness to His chosen people and His willingness to help anyone who turns to Him.

The historical context of the chapter is important to understand, as it was written during the time when the Israelites were in Babylonian captivity. The chapter speaks of their deliverance and restoration, which was eventually fulfilled when Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Israelites to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple.

Theologians and scholars interpret this chapter as a prophecy of Cyrus, who was used by God to deliver Israel from Babylonian captivity. They also see it as a declaration of God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His people.

There are no significant controversies related to this chapter, but some people may interpret it differently, depending on their theological beliefs.

Isaiah 45 relates to other chapters and themes in the Bible, such as the promise of deliverance and restoration for God's chosen people, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. The chapter also emphasizes the importance of acknowledging God as the one true God, which is a central theme in the Bible.

The main lesson that can be taken from this chapter is that God is in control of history, and He can use anyone to achieve His purposes. It also emphasizes the importance of acknowledging God as the one true God and turning to Him for salvation.

## Summary

Isaiah 21 is a chapter of prophecy and judgment, which is directed towards both Tyre and the surrounding regions of Edom and Arabia. The chapter begins with a burden, or prophecy, concerning the desert by the sea. The prophet sees a vision of a terrifying land coming from the desert, like whirlwinds in the South sweeping through. This vision is likely a warning of impending judgment to the nations of the region.

The first part of the chapter focuses on the judgment that is coming upon Tyre. Tyre was a wealthy and powerful city-state located on the coast of modern-day Lebanon. The chapter predicts that the city will fall and its inhabitants will flee to the ships that once brought wealth and prosperity to the city. The prophet describes the city as being "laid waste", and the chapter ends with a picture of a watchman seeing a rider and a pair of horsemen approaching, calling out, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the images of her gods he has shattered to the ground."

The second part of the chapter contains oracles against Edom and Arabia. These regions were located to the south and east of Israel, and were often at odds with the Israelites. The prophet predicts that these nations will also experience judgment and destruction, with their people fleeing to the mountains for safety.

Throughout the chapter, there are several key verses that stand out. One such verse is verse 9, which states, "And behold, here come riders, horsemen in pairs!" This verse is significant because it foreshadows the fall of Babylon, which is mentioned in verse 10. Another key verse is verse 16, which describes a message that the prophet has received from the Lord, saying, "Within a year, according to the years of a hired worker, all the glory of Kedar will come to an end." This verse predicts the downfall of Kedar, which was a tribe of people in Arabia.

The main themes of this chapter are judgment and prophecy. The prophet is warning the nations of Tyre, Edom, and Arabia that they will experience destruction and devastation because of their sins and unfaithfulness to God. The chapter also emphasizes the power and sovereignty of God, who is able to bring about judgment and fulfill his prophetic promises.

To understand the context of this chapter, it is important to note that it was written during a time of political unrest and upheaval in the ancient Near East. The Assyrian Empire was expanding, and many smaller nations were being threatened and conquered. The prophet Isaiah was speaking to his fellow Israelites, warning them of the dangers that lay ahead and calling them to turn back to God.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter in several ways. Some see it as a warning to other nations to turn back to God and avoid the same judgment that will come upon Tyre, Edom, and Arabia. Others see it as a message of hope, reminding the Israelites that God is in control and will ultimately bring about justice and redemption.

There are several controversies related to this chapter, including the identity of the "rider" and "horsemen" mentioned in verse 9, and the exact location of the "desert by the sea" mentioned in verse 1. These controversies are largely unresolved, and different scholars and theologians have proposed various interpretations.

Overall, Isaiah 21 is a chapter of warning and prophecy, emphasizing the power and sovereignty of God and the need for repentance and faithfulness. The lessons and morals that can be taken from this chapter include the importance of obedience to God, the consequences of sin, and the hope of redemption and restoration.

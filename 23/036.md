## Subheadings

* From verse 1 - Sennacherib's Invasion

## Summary

Isaiah 36 is a chapter in the book of Isaiah which recounts the events surrounding Sennacherib's invasion of Judah, the southern kingdom of Israel, during the reign of Hezekiah. This chapter serves as a bridge between the first section of the book of Isaiah (chapters 1-35) which focuses on the prophecy of judgment against Judah and Israel, and the second section (chapters 40-66) which focuses on the prophecy of restoration and hope for Godâ€™s people.

Sennacherib's Invasion
The chapter begins by stating that in the 14th year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, invaded Judah and captured all its fortified cities. Hezekiah then sent a message to the Assyrian king, acknowledging his power and wealth, but proclaiming his trust in the Lord God of Israel. In response, Sennacherib sent his chief officer, the Rabshakeh, to persuade the people of Judah to surrender and submit to Assyria.

The Rabshakeh's Speech
The Rabshakeh stood outside the walls of Jerusalem and called out to the people, mocking their reliance on their God and boasting of Assyria's military might and conquests. He claimed that the gods of other nations had been unable to protect them from Assyria and that the God of Israel would be no different. He also offered to make a deal with the people of Judah, promising them safety and prosperity if they surrendered to Assyria.

Hezekiah's Response
Upon hearing the Rabshakeh's speech, Hezekiah and his officials tore their clothes in mourning and sought the counsel of the prophet Isaiah. Isaiah reassured them that the Lord would protect Jerusalem and that Sennacherib's army would be defeated. Hezekiah then prayed to the Lord, acknowledging His sovereignty and asking for His deliverance and protection. In response, the Lord sent an angel to strike down 185,000 Assyrian soldiers, causing Sennacherib to retreat back to Assyria.

Interpretation and Lessons
The chapter highlights the power of prayer and faith in God's protection, as demonstrated by Hezekiah's response to the Rabshakeh's threats. It also emphasizes the importance of seeking wise counsel and listening to the voice of the prophet. The message of the chapter is that even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, those who put their trust in God will be delivered and protected. 

The historical context of the chapter is important to understand the significance of the events. Assyria was a powerful empire that had already conquered the northern kingdom of Israel and threatened the southern kingdom of Judah. Hezekiah's reign was marked by religious reforms and a return to faith in the God of Israel. The Rabshakeh's speech reveals the Assyrian's contempt for the God of Israel and their belief in their own power and gods.

Scholars have noted the similarities between Isaiah 36-39 and 2 Kings 18-20, which also recount the events of Sennacherib's invasion and Hezekiah's response. Some have debated the historical accuracy of the account, while others see it as a testament to the power of faith and prayer.

Overall, Isaiah 36 serves as a reminder of the importance of trust in God's protection and deliverance, even in the face of overwhelming opposition. It also highlights the significance of seeking wise counsel and listening to the voice of the prophet.

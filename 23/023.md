# Isaiah 23

## Subheadings

* From verse 1 - Divine Judgment on Tyre

## Summary

Isaiah 23 is a prophecy concerning the city of Tyre, a major port city in ancient Phoenicia. The chapter predicts the destruction and downfall of the city, and the reasons for its judgment.

The chapter is structured into two parts. The first part, from verse 1 to 14, describes the judgment of Tyre. The second part, from verse 15 to 18, describes Tyre's eventual restoration.

In the first part of the chapter, the prophecy begins with a call to lament for Tyre's destruction. The ships of Tarshish are called upon to wail for Tyre, as it is destroyed and left without a house or harbor. This is a significant event, as Tyre was a wealthy and powerful city, known for its maritime trade.

The reason for Tyre's judgment is stated in verse 9: "The Lord Almighty planned it, to bring down her pride in all her splendor and to humble all who are renowned on the earth." The chapter goes on to describe how Tyre's wealth and pride will be taken away, and how the city will become a desolate place.

Verse 10 states that "Over the sea, Tyre will be forgotten", indicating that the city's destruction will be so complete that it will be forgotten by the rest of the world.

The second part of the chapter describes Tyre's eventual restoration. It predicts that after 70 years, Tyre will be restored and resume its trade. However, the chapter ends with a warning that Tyre's riches will not be used for the benefit of its people, but for the Lord's purposes.

One key verse in this chapter is verse 14, which states that Tyre's wealth will be dedicated to the Lord. This indicates that the ultimate purpose of Tyre's judgment is to bring glory to God, and to humble those who have put their trust in wealth and power.

The main themes of the chapter include divine judgment, pride, and the sovereignty of God. The chapter demonstrates that God is in control of the rise and fall of nations, and that even the wealthiest and most powerful cities are subject to his judgment.

To understand the historical context of Isaiah 23, it is important to note that Tyre was a major city in the ancient world, known for its maritime trade and wealth. The city was a center of Phoenician culture, and played an important role in the politics and economy of the region.

Many theologians and scholars interpret this chapter as a warning against pride and materialism. They see the judgment of Tyre as a reminder that the pursuit of wealth and power can lead to destruction and downfall.

There are some controversies surrounding the interpretation of this chapter, particularly with regard to the timing of Tyre's restoration. Some scholars argue that the restoration predicted in the chapter refers to a later period in history, rather than a literal 70-year period.

Isaiah 23 relates to other chapters and themes in the Bible, particularly those that deal with divine judgment and the sovereignty of God. It also relates to themes of pride and materialism, which are addressed in other prophetic books such as Amos and Micah.

The lesson that can be taken from this chapter is that wealth and power are fleeting, and that true security can only be found in God. The chapter reminds us that God is in control of the rise and fall of nations, and that our ultimate allegiance should be to him, rather than to material possessions or worldly power.

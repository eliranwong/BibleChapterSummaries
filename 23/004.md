From verse 2 - The Glorious Future of the Remnant

## Summary

Isaiah 4 is a prophecy that talks about the future of Judah and Jerusalem. The chapter starts with a description of a time when seven women will take hold of one man, willing to share his name and family, but providing for themselves. This scenario suggests that there will be a severe shortage of men and that women will be desperate to avoid the stigma of being unmarried. 

The second verse begins with the phrase "In that day," which indicates that this is a continuation of the prophecy from the previous chapter. The chapter goes on to describe a glorious future for the remnant of Israel. The Lord will cleanse Jerusalem and remove the bloodstains from the city by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of burning. 

Verses 4-6 describe how the Lord will provide a shelter and shade for the remnant of Israel. The Lord will create a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night, like a canopy over the remnant. This imagery is reminiscent of the cloud and fire that guided the Israelites through the wilderness. The Lord's presence will be with them, and it will be a shelter from the heat of the day and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain. 

The chapter concludes with a reminder that the Lord will be a refuge and a fortress for the remnant of Israel. The emphasis is on the importance of righteousness and holiness. Only those who are written in the book of life will be saved.

## Summary

Isaiah 56 is a chapter that focuses on righteousness and inclusivity in worship. The prophet Isaiah begins the chapter by relaying a message from the Lord to keep justice and righteousness because His salvation is close to coming and His righteousness will soon be revealed. The Lord then goes on to speak to eunuchs and foreigners, assuring them that they too will be included in His kingdom if they keep His commandments.

From verse 1, we learn that the Lord values justice and righteousness. This is a recurring theme in the book of Isaiah, as the prophet often spoke out against the injustices of his time. The Lord's message in this chapter is a call for His people to live in a way that reflects His values. The Lord's salvation is close to coming, and His righteousness will soon be revealed, so it is important for His people to be prepared.

In verses 2-5, the Lord speaks directly to eunuchs and foreigners. Eunuchs were often seen as outcasts in ancient Israel because they were unable to have children. Foreigners were also viewed with suspicion because they were not part of the chosen people. However, the Lord assures them that they too will be included in His kingdom if they keep His commandments. The Lord promises that He will give them a place and a name in His house, a place better than sons and daughters. This is a radical message of inclusivity in a time when exclusion was the norm.

In verses 6-8, the Lord speaks to His people, promising blessings for those who keep His commandments. He promises to gather the outcasts of Israel and to bring them to His holy mountain. He also promises to make His house a house of prayer for all peoples. This is another message of inclusivity, as the Lord's house was traditionally seen as a place only for the chosen people.

From verse 9, Isaiah warns the wicked and the destitute. He warns that those who oppress the poor and the needy will be punished. He also warns those who are foolish and have no understanding that they will be destroyed. This is a reminder that the Lord's love and inclusivity do not mean that there will be no consequences for sin.

In conclusion, Isaiah 56 is a chapter that emphasizes the importance of righteousness and inclusivity in worship. The Lord's message to eunuchs and foreigners is a radical message of inclusivity that challenges the exclusivity of ancient Israel. The Lord promises blessings for those who keep His commandments, but also warns of punishment for those who oppress the poor and the needy. Ultimately, the chapter reminds us that God's love and inclusivity are balanced by His justice and righteousness.

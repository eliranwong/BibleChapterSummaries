## Summary

Isaiah 46 is a prophetic chapter that speaks of the downfall of Babylon and the sovereignty of God.

The idols are shown to be burdensome and powerless, unable to save or help their worshippers.

The verses in this chapter are structured around two main themes: the futility of idol worship and the power of God. The first section highlights the foolishness of those who trust in idols, while the second section emphasizes the faithfulness and strength of God.

The key verses in this chapter are verses 3-4, where God declares, "Listen to me...I have upheld you since your birth, and I have carried you from the womb; even to your old age and gray hairs I am he, I am he who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you."

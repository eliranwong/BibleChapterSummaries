The verses in this chapter are structured in several subheadings that address different aspects of holiness in the priesthood.

The third section (verses 10-15) deals with the prohibition on priests with physical defects from serving in the sanctuary. The fourth section (verses 16-24) addresses the genealogy of the priests and the restrictions on their eligibility to serve.

One of the key verses in this chapter is verse 6, which says, "They must be holy to their God and must not profane the name of their God. Because they present the food offerings to the Lord, the food of their God, they are to be holy."

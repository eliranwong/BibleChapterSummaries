* From verse 1 - Cleansing from skin diseases and mildew

## Summary

Leviticus 14 outlines the regulations for cleansing individuals from skin diseases and mildew. The chapter begins with the Lord speaking to Moses and instructing him on how to carry out the purification process.

The chapter is structured in such a way that it outlines the different steps that must be taken to cleanse someone who has been afflicted with a skin disease or mildew. The first part of the chapter deals with the procedures for purifying a person who has been healed of leprosy. The priest is to examine the individual and declare him clean if he is free from the disease. The priest is then to take two live birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop, and use them to perform a ritual that symbolizes the cleansing of the individual. One of the birds is killed and its blood is sprinkled on the person who is being cleansed. The live bird is then dipped in the blood and released into the open field. The individual is then required to shave off all his hair, wash his clothes, and bathe himself before he can be declared clean.

The second part of the chapter deals with the purification of a house that has been affected by mildew. The priest is to inspect the house and if he finds that the mildew has spread, he is to have the affected stones removed and thrown outside the city. The priest is then to scrape off the remaining mildew and have the house plastered with fresh clay. If the mildew reappears, the house is to be destroyed.

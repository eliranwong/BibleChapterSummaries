## Summary

2 Samuel 15 provides an account of Absalom's conspiracy to overthrow his father, King David, and the subsequent events leading to David's flight from Jerusalem.

The chapter begins with Absalom's preparation for his uprising against his father. He creates a chariot and horses for himself and fifty men to run before him. He also stands at the city gate and greets people, offering to solve their problems if he were appointed as a judge. His actions gain him a following, and he begins to gather support for his rebellion.

Absalom then seeks permission from David to go to Hebron to fulfill a vow he made to God. David grants him permission, unaware of Absalom's true intentions. Once in Hebron, Absalom declares himself king and gains the support of many people.

David soon learns of Absalom's actions and decides to flee Jerusalem with his family and loyal followers to avoid a violent confrontation. He leaves behind ten concubines to take care of the palace, while his trusted advisor, Hushai, stays behind to gather information about Absalom's plans.

The chapter is structured in a chronological sequence of events, starting with Absalom's preparations for his rebellion and ending with David's flight from Jerusalem.

The key verse in this chapter is verse 6, which reads, "And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel." This verse highlights Absalom's deceitful actions and his ability to manipulate people to gain their support.

The significant characters in this chapter are Absalom and King David. Absalom is portrayed as a power-hungry and deceitful son who seeks to overthrow his father and gain the throne.

Absalom's rebellion is a result of his sinful desires, and it leads to his downfall.

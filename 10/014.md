* From verse 1 - The return of Absalom

## Summary

2 Samuel 14 is a chapter in the book of 2 Samuel that tells the story of Absalom's return from exile. The chapter begins with Joab, the commander of David's army, realizing that David is still grieving over the loss of Absalom, his son who had rebelled against him. Joab devises a plan to bring Absalom back to Jerusalem.

The chapter is structured as a narrative, with the story unfolding through conversations between Joab and a wise woman from Tekoa who he hires to help him with his plan. The woman pretends to be a widow seeking the king's help to save her remaining son from being killed by her family for a crime he committed. She uses this story to make a case for David to reconcile with Absalom and bring him back to Jerusalem.

There are several key verses in this chapter, including verse 14 where the wise woman says, "We all must die eventually. Our lives are like water spilled out on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God does not just sweep life away; instead, he devises ways to bring us back when we have been separated from him." This verse speaks to the theme of forgiveness and reconciliation that runs throughout the chapter.

The chapter also introduces the character of the wise woman from Tekoa, who is significant for her role in Joab's plan. Her use of a parable to persuade David to reconcile with Absalom shows her wisdom and intelligence, and her words are ultimately successful in convincing David to bring Absalom back to Jerusalem.

The main themes of this chapter are forgiveness, reconciliation, and the consequences of rebellion. The story of Absalom's exile and eventual return highlights the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation in relationships, even when there has been a significant breach of trust. The chapter also shows the consequences of rebellion, as Absalom's actions led to his exile and separation from his family.

Understanding the historical and cultural context of this chapter is important to fully grasp its significance. The story takes place in ancient Israel during the reign of King David, and is part of a larger narrative that tells the story of David's rise to power and his struggles to maintain it. The themes of forgiveness and rebellion were important in ancient Israelite culture, and this chapter reflects those values.

Theologians, scholars, and religious leaders have interpreted this chapter in a variety of ways. Some see it as a cautionary tale about the dangers of rebellion and the importance of forgiveness, while others focus on the character of the wise woman and her role in persuading David to reconcile with Absalom.

There are no major controversies surrounding this chapter, although there is some debate about the historical accuracy of the story and whether it should be interpreted as a literal account or a symbolic one.

2 Samuel 14 is part of a larger narrative that tells the story of David's reign and his struggles with his family and political enemies.

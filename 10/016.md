## Summary

2 Samuel 16 is a chapter in the Old Testament that details David's escape from his son Absalom who had rebelled against him. The chapter begins with David passing beyond the summit and meeting Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, who brings him provisions of bread, raisins, figs, and wine. 

The structure of the chapter revolves around David's encounters with different characters as he flees from Absalom. In verses 1-4, David encounters Ziba, who tells him that Mephibosheth has joined Absalom's rebellion. In verses 5-14, David encounters Shimei, who curses him and throws stones at him. In verses 15-19, David meets Hushai, who offers to accompany him and provide counsel. 

One of the key verses in the chapter is verse 9, where Shimei curses David and says, "The Lord has avenged on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned, and the Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, your evil is on you, for you are a man of blood." This verse highlights the tension between David and the house of Saul and foreshadows the conflict between David and Absalom.

## Summary

2 Samuel 21 is divided into two main sections. The first section, from verse 1 to verse 14, is about the Gibeonites' revenge. The second section, from verse 15 to verse 22, is about battles with the Philistine giants.

The first verse of the chapter highlights that there was a famine in the land for three years, and David sought the face of the Lord. The Lord revealed to him that the famine was a result of Saul's actions against the Gibeonites. This shows that God holds leaders accountable for their actions and that there are consequences for disobedience.

In the first section, the Gibeonites asked for vengeance against Saul's house, and David agreed to their request. This shows that David valued the importance of keeping his promises and meeting the needs of others, even when it meant going against his own interests. The Gibeonites' request for vengeance may also be seen as a call for justice since Saul's actions had caused harm to their people.

The second section of the chapter describes battles with Philistine giants. David and his men faced four Philistine giants, descendants of the giant Goliath whom David had defeated earlier. The battles show that even though the Israelites had previously defeated the Philistines, they still had to remain vigilant and fight to protect their land and people. It also highlights that God can use unexpected individuals like David, who was not a trained warrior, to defeat powerful enemies.

The chapter has several key verses, including verse 3, where the Gibeonites declare that they do not want silver or gold as compensation, but instead want seven of Saul's male descendants to be hanged. This reveals the severity of Saul's actions against the Gibeonites, and the need for justice to be served. Another key verse is verse 22, where it is stated that the four Philistine giants were descendants of Goliath. This shows that the Israelites' victory over Goliath was not the end of their conflict with the Philistines, and that they could still face challenges from their enemies.

The chapter also includes significant characters, events, and symbols. The Gibeonites are significant characters as they play a central role in the first section, and their request for justice is a recurring theme in the chapter. The four Philistine giants are also significant characters as they represent a threat to the Israelites, and their defeat by David and his men highlights the power of God to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The famine is a symbol of God's judgment against Saul's actions, and the hanging of Saul's descendants is a symbol of the consequences of disobedience.

The main theme of the chapter is justice, both in terms of the Gibeonites' request for vengeance and in the battles with the Philistine giants. The chapter also highlights the importance of seeking God's guidance and trusting in Him during times of hardship and conflict.

The historical and cultural context of the chapter is important to understand. The Gibeonites were a group of people who had made a treaty with the Israelites during Joshua's conquest of Canaan. Saul's actions against the Gibeonites were a violation of this treaty, and his disobedience led to God's judgment against him and his descendants. The battles with the Philistine giants also reflect the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Philistines during this time period.

Theologians, scholars, and religious leaders have interpreted this chapter in various ways. Some see the chapter as a reminder of the importance of justice and keeping promises, while others focus on the symbolism of the famine and the hanging of Saul's descendants. There have also been debates about the historicity of the battles with the Philistine giants and the accuracy of the genealogies mentioned in the chapter.

Overall, 2 Samuel 21 is a complex chapter that highlights the themes of justice, obedience, and trust in God. It shows that God holds leaders accountable for their actions and that there are consequences for disobedience. The chapter also highlights the power of God to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles and the importance of seeking His guidance during times of hardship and conflict.

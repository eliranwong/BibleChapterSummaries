## Summary

Joshua 21 is an important chapter in the book of Joshua that deals with the allocation of cities to the Levites. The chapter begins with the chiefs of the Levites approaching Eleazar the priest, Joshua, and the chiefs of the tribes of Israel. They request that they be given cities to live in, as was commanded by the Lord through Moses. 

The verses in this chapter are organized into sections that list the cities that were given to the Levites from each of the tribes of Israel. The Levites received a total of 48 cities, along with their surrounding pasturelands. The cities were allocated based on the size of the tribe, with larger tribes receiving more cities than smaller ones. 

There are no specific key verses or passages in this chapter, as it primarily lists the cities that were given to the Levites. However, there are some significant characters mentioned, such as Eleazar the priest, Joshua, and the chiefs of the tribes of Israel.

The main theme of this chapter is the fulfillment of God's commandment to give the Levites cities to live in. This was necessary because the Levites were not given a specific portion of land like the other tribes. Instead, they were to serve as priests and caretakers of the tabernacle and were supported by the tithes and offerings of the other tribes.

It is important to understand the historical and cultural context of this chapter. During the time of Joshua, the Levites were a separate tribe that served as priests and caretakers of the tabernacle. They were not given a specific portion of land like the other tribes, but were instead scattered throughout Israel. The allocation of cities to the Levites was a fulfillment of God's commandment to provide for their needs and ensure their survival.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter as a demonstration of God's faithfulness in fulfilling his promises to the Israelites. Despite their disobedience and unfaithfulness, God remained faithful to his covenant with them and provided for their needs.

There are no major controversies or popular interpretations related to this chapter.

This chapter relates to other chapters in the book of Joshua that deal with the allocation of land to the tribes of Israel. It also relates to themes throughout the Bible of God's faithfulness and provision for his people.

The lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of trusting in God's faithfulness and provision. Even in difficult or uncertain times, we can trust that God will provide for our needs and fulfill his promises to us. We should also remember to support and care for those who serve God's purposes, as the Israelites did for the Levites.

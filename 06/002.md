## Summary

Joshua 2 is an interesting and pivotal chapter in the book of Joshua. It tells the story of how Joshua sent two spies to Jericho to gather intelligence about the city and its defenses before the Israelites attacked. The chapter is divided into three sections, each with its own distinct focus.

* From verse 1 - Entering the city
The chapter begins with Joshua sending two spies to Jericho to gather intelligence about the city. The spies entered the city and went to the house of a prostitute named Rahab, where they lodged for the night. The fact that they entered the house of a prostitute is significant, as it shows that they were willing to go to great lengths to accomplish their mission. However, their presence was soon discovered, and the king of Jericho sent soldiers to capture them.

* From verse 8 - Rahab's assistance
Rahab, who had heard about the Israelites and their God, hid the spies and helped them escape. She asked them to spare her and her family when they conquered the city, and the spies agreed, telling her to hang a scarlet cord from her window so that they would recognize her house. Rahab's actions show that she had faith in God and was willing to risk her life to help his people. The scarlet cord is also significant, as it foreshadows the blood of Jesus that would later save all who have faith in him.

* From verse 22 - Return and report
The chapter ends with the two spies returning to Joshua and reporting what they had learned. They told him that the people of Jericho were afraid of the Israelites and that the city was well-fortified. They also reported Rahab's help and her request for salvation. Joshua then orders the Israelites to prepare for battle and tells them that God will give them the city.

The main theme of this chapter is faith. It shows how God can use anyone, even a prostitute, to accomplish his purposes. It also demonstrates the importance of trusting in God, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The scarlet cord is a symbol of this faith, as it represents the hope of salvation through the blood of Jesus.

The historical context of this chapter is important to understand. The Israelites were on the verge of entering the Promised Land, and they needed to conquer the cities that lay ahead of them. Jericho was the first city they had to conquer, and it was a formidable opponent. However, God had promised to give them the land, and they had faith that he would keep his promise.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter in various ways. Some see it as a story of redemption, as Rahab's faith saved her and her family from destruction. Others see it as an example of God's grace, as he used an unlikely source to accomplish his purposes. Still, others see it as a demonstration of the importance of faith in God's plan.

There are no significant controversies related to this chapter, but it does relate to other chapters and themes in the Bible. The scarlet cord is a precursor to the blood of Jesus, which would later save all who have faith in him. It also foreshadows the Passover, where the Israelites were saved from death by the blood of a lamb.

The lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of faith. It shows that God can use anyone, regardless of their background or profession, to accomplish his purposes. It also demonstrates the power of faith in overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

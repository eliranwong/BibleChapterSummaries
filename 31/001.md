## Summary

Obadiah 1 is a prophecy by Obadiah concerning the nation of Edom. The chapter begins with an introduction in which Obadiah declares that he has received a vision from God concerning Edom. The Lord has heard a report and sent a messenger among the nations to rise up against Edom for battle.

The chapter is structured in such a way that it first talks about the humiliation and destruction of Edom, followed by the wisdom of Edom, the violence against Jacob, Edom's indifference and betrayal of Jerusalem, judgment upon the nations, the restoration of Israel, Israel's expansion, and finally, the Lord's rule.

In verses 2-4, Obadiah declares that Edom will be brought low and their pride will be their downfall. The Lord will destroy their cities, and their wise men will be deceived. This is because of their pride and arrogance, which led them to believe that they were invincible.

In verses 5-7, the destruction of Edom is depicted in graphic detail. Their treasures will be plundered, their allies will turn against them, and they will be destroyed utterly. This is because of their violence against their brother Jacob.

In verse 8, the wisdom of Edom is described. They were known for their wisdom and understanding, but this did not save them from destruction. Their wisdom was useless in the face of the Lord's judgment.

In verses 10-14, the violence against Jacob is described in detail. Edom was complicit in the destruction of Jerusalem, and they will be held accountable for it. They stood by and did nothing as their brother was destroyed, and they will be destroyed in turn.

In verses 15-16, the judgment upon the nations is described. The day of the Lord is coming, and all the nations will be judged. This judgment will be based on their treatment of Israel.

In verses 17-18, the restoration of Israel is described. They will be delivered from their enemies, and their land will be restored to them.

In verses 19-20, Israel's expansion is described. They will possess the land of Edom, and the Lord will reign over them.

Finally, in verse 21, the Lord's rule is declared. The kingdom will be the Lord's, and he will reign forever.

The main theme of the chapter is the judgment of Edom for their violence against Israel. The historical context of the chapter is the destruction of Jerusalem by Babylon and the subsequent exile of the Israelites. The prophecy was likely given during this time to comfort the Israelites and assure them that their enemies would be held accountable for their actions.

Theologians and scholars interpret this chapter as a warning against pride and arrogance. Edom's downfall was brought about by their belief in their invincibility, and this serves as a warning to all who would place their trust in their own strength and wisdom.

There are no significant controversies or popular interpretations related to this chapter.

This chapter relates to other chapters and themes in the Bible, particularly those concerning the judgment of nations and the restoration of Israel.

The lesson to be taken from this chapter is the importance of humility and obedience to God. The downfall of Edom serves as a warning to all who would place their trust in their own strength and wisdom rather than in the Lord.

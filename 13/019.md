## Summary

1 Chronicles 19 begins by stating that King Nahash of the Ammonites had died and his son had taken over as the new ruler. David, the king of Israel, sent condolences to the new Ammonite king in order to establish peaceful relations between their two kingdoms. However, the Ammonite officials suspected David of sending spies to gather intelligence for an invasion, and they humiliated David's messengers by shaving off half of their beards and cutting their garments.

War against the Ammonites
Upon hearing of this insult, David sent Joab, his army commander, with a large force to retaliate against the Ammonites. The Ammonites hired mercenaries from surrounding nations to help them fight, but David's army was successful in defeating them and their allies in several battles. The Ammonites eventually retreated to their capital city, Rabbah, where David's army laid siege to the city.

## Summary

Deuteronomy 26 is part of Moses’ farewell address to the Israelites, as he prepares them to enter the Promised Land. In this chapter, Moses instructs the people on how to bring their firstfruits and tithes to the Lord once they settle in the land.

The chapter starts by reminding the Israelites that the land they are about to possess is a gift from God. Moses instructs them to take the firstfruits of their harvest and bring them to the priest at the sanctuary, saying, “I declare today to the Lord your God that I have come into the land that the Lord swore to our fathers to give us” (Deuteronomy 26:3). The Israelites were to make a confession of faith when they presented their offering, acknowledging God’s faithfulness to his promises and to their forefathers.

Moses then proceeds to instruct them on how to present their tithes. He reminds them to give a tenth of their produce to the Levites, the foreigners, the fatherless, and the widows. They were to do this every third year, and they were to declare before the Lord that they had done as he commanded them, saying, “I have not transgressed any of your commandments, nor have I forgotten them” (Deuteronomy 26:13).

The chapter emphasizes the importance of obedience to God’s commands and the need to remember his faithfulness. The Israelites were to remember their past as slaves in Egypt and how God had delivered them and brought them to the Promised Land. They were to acknowledge that their prosperity was a result of God’s provision and that they were to be grateful for his blessings.

In terms of structure, the chapter is organized around the theme of offerings and tithes.

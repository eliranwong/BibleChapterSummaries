* From verse 1 - Laws concerning Worship and Idolatry

## Summary

Deuteronomy 12 is a continuation of Moses' address to the Israelites as they prepare to enter the Promised Land. In this chapter, Moses gives specific instructions on how to worship God and warns against idolatry.

The chapter is organized into several sections, each addressing a different aspect of worship and idolatry. The first section, from verse 1, emphasizes the importance of following God's statutes and judgments in the Promised Land. Moses instructs the Israelites to destroy all the places where the Canaanites had worshiped their gods and to worship only the Lord at the place that He would choose.

The second section, from verse 5, focuses on the proper way to offer sacrifices and worship God. Moses commands the Israelites to bring all their offerings to the place that God would choose and to offer them only as He had commanded. He also forbids them from offering sacrifices anywhere else, warning them that doing so would be considered idolatry.

In the third section, from verse 13, Moses instructs the Israelites on the proper way to eat meat. He commands them to slaughter animals only at the place that God would choose and to offer certain parts of the animals as sacrifices to Him. He also forbids them from eating the blood of any animal, as it is considered sacred to God.

The fourth section, from verse 15, addresses the issue of tithes. Moses commands the Israelites to bring a tenth of their produce to the place that God would choose and to offer it as a sacrifice to Him.

Finally, in the last section, from verse 29, Moses warns the Israelites against following the practices of the nations that they would displace in the Promised Land. He reminds them that they are to worship only the Lord and to follow His statutes and judgments.

One key verse in this chapter is verse 5, which states, "But you shall seek the place that the Lord your God will choose out of all your tribes to put his name and make his habitation there. There you shall go."

This verse emphasizes the importance of worshiping God in the place that He has chosen and following His commands. It also highlights the centrality of the Temple in Jewish worship and the significance of Jerusalem as the location of the Temple.

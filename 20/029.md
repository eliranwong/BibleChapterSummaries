The chapter is organized into three main sections, each dealing with a different topic related to these themes. The first section, from verse 1 to verse 11, focuses on the consequences of a person's actions. The second section, from verse 12 to verse 26, deals with the importance of wise counsel and the danger of flattery. The final section, from verse 27 to verse 30, is about the importance of discipline and self-control.

The first verse of the chapter sets the tone for the rest of the section on righteousness, justice, and trust. It warns that those who are argumentative and stubborn will eventually face consequences that cannot be undone.

The first section of the chapter serves as an introduction to Agur. In verse 2, Agur describes how he is more ignorant than any man and lacks understanding. Despite this, Agur acknowledges the wisdom of God and seeks to understand his ways. In verses 3-4, Agur asks a series of rhetorical questions that emphasize the greatness and incomprehensibility of God. He acknowledges that God's word is pure and that he is a shield to those who trust in him.

Proverbs on Animals
The second section of the chapter focuses on proverbs about animals. In verses 10-14, Agur describes four types of people who are never satisfied. He compares them to leeches, the grave, barren wombs, and the earth that is never full. Agur then describes four things that are small but wise: ants, rock badgers, locusts, and spiders. These creatures are praised for their wisdom and industry.

Sayings on Human Behavior
The final section of the chapter contains various sayings about human behavior. In verses 15-16, Agur describes the insatiable nature of the leech and compares it to the greed of those who pursue wealth. In verses 17-20, Agur describes the wonders of creation, including the way of an eagle in the sky and the way of a serpent on a rock. In verses 21-23, Agur describes three things that are mysterious and wonderful: the way of an adulterous woman, the way of a man with a maid, and the way of a servant who becomes a king. 

In verses 24-28, Agur describes four things that are small but wise: ants, rock badgers, locusts, and spiders.

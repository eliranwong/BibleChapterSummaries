The verses in this chapter are structured in a way that contrasts wisdom with foolishness. In many of the proverbs, a foolish behavior or attitude is described, followed by the negative consequences that result from it.

- "A sluggard says, 'Thereâ€™s a lion in the road, a fierce lion roaming the streets!'" (Proverbs 26:13)

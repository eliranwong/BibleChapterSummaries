The final part, from verses 21 to 33, talks about the future restoration of Israel.

Key verses in the chapter include verse 6, which states: "But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people and the sword comes and takes someone's life, that person's life will be taken because of their sin, but I will hold the watchman accountable for their blood." This verse emphasizes the importance of the watchman's role and the consequences of failing to fulfill it.

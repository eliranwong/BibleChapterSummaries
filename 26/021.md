* From verse 1 - Parable of the Forest Fire

## Summary

Ezekiel 21 is a chapter in which the prophet Ezekiel receives a word from the Lord regarding the impending judgment that will come upon the people of Judah. The chapter is structured around a parable of a forest fire, which serves as a metaphor for the coming destruction.

The chapter begins with the phrase, "And the word of the Lord came to me, saying," indicating that Ezekiel is receiving a direct message from God. This sets the tone for the rest of the chapter, which is a warning of impending judgment.

The parable of the forest fire begins in verse 2, where the Lord commands Ezekiel to prophesy against the land of Israel. He tells Ezekiel to say, "Behold, I am against you, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked." This indicates that the coming judgment will be severe and indiscriminate.

The parable continues with the Lord describing a sword that he will draw against the people of Judah. The sword is described as a "slaughter weapon" that will strike down both the righteous and the wicked. The Lord declares that he will set the sword against all the people of Judah, including the king and his princes.

In verses 8-17, the Lord describes the different groups of people who will be affected by the coming judgment. He mentions the prophets, who will be mocked and ridiculed for their false prophecies, and the people of the land, who will be filled with terror and despair. The Lord also mentions the king and his princes, who will be taken captive and brought before the king of Babylon.

The chapter ends with a call to repentance. The Lord tells Ezekiel to "clap your hands" and "stamp your foot" as a sign of mourning for the coming judgment. He also tells Ezekiel to prophesy against the "two ways" that the people of Judah have chosen, one leading to life and the other to death. The Lord offers the people a chance to repent and turn from their wicked ways, but warns that judgment is coming regardless.

The main theme of Ezekiel 21 is the coming judgment and the need for repentance. The parable of the forest fire serves as a powerful metaphor for the destruction that will come upon the people of Judah. The Lord's call to repentance is a reminder that even in the face of judgment, there is still hope for those who turn to him.

In terms of historical context, Ezekiel 21 was likely written during the time of the Babylonian exile, when the people of Judah were facing the consequences of their disobedience to God. The chapter reflects the prophetic tradition of warning the people of impending judgment and calling them to repentance.

Scholars and theologians have interpreted Ezekiel 21 in a variety of ways. Some see it as a call to repentance for the people of Judah, while others see it as a warning of judgment for all people. Some have also interpreted the parable of the forest fire as a symbol of the purifying power of God's judgment.

One popular interpretation of Ezekiel 21 is that it relates to the concept of the "remnant" in the Bible. The remnant refers to a small group of faithful believers who are left after a time of judgment, and who are called to rebuild and restore God's people. This interpretation sees Ezekiel 21 as a call for the remnant to remain faithful and to trust in God's plan for restoration.

Overall, Ezekiel 21 is a powerful chapter that serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the need for repentance. Its message of hope in the face of judgment is a timeless reminder of God's mercy and love for his people.

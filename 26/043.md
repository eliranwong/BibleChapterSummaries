## Summary

Ezekiel 43 is a chapter that describes the vision of the prophet Ezekiel, who is taken to the gate that faces towards the east. In this chapter, Ezekiel sees the return of God's glory to the Temple, and he is shown the measurements and rules for the altar. 

The first section of the chapter (verses 1-12) describes the return of God's glory to the Temple. Ezekiel sees a vision of the glory of the Lord coming into the Temple from the east, just as he had seen it leave from the east in a previous vision. The glory of the Lord fills the Temple, and Ezekiel falls on his face in worship. The chapter emphasizes the holiness and majesty of God, and how His glory is central to the Temple. 

The second section of the chapter (verses 13-27) describes the altar and its rules. Ezekiel is shown the measurements of the altar, and the Lord gives him instructions on how it should be used. The altar is a place of sacrifice, where the people of Israel can offer their offerings and make atonement for their sins. The chapter emphasizes the importance of following God's rules for the altar, and the consequences of disobedience. 

The chapter is structured in a way that first describes the return of God's glory, and then focuses on the altar and its rules. The key verse in this chapter is verse 7, where the Lord says, "Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet. This is where I will live among the Israelites forever." This verse emphasizes the centrality of the Temple and the altar in God's relationship with His people. 

The main theme of this chapter is the holiness of God and the importance of following His rules. The chapter emphasizes the idea that God's glory is manifested in the Temple, and that the altar is a place where the people of Israel can come to make atonement for their sins. The chapter also emphasizes the consequences of disobedience, and the importance of following God's commands. 

To understand this chapter, it is important to consider the historical and cultural context of the time. The Temple was a central part of Jewish worship, and the rules and regulations for the altar were crucial in maintaining the purity of the worship. The chapter also reflects the prophetic tradition of the Hebrew Bible, where prophets like Ezekiel were called to warn the people of Israel about the consequences of disobedience.

The chapter is structured into two main sections. The first section (verses 1-4) describes the prophet's entrance into the temple's inner sanctuary, where he sees the measurements of the holy place. The second section (verses 5-26) describes the details of the temple's structure, including its walls, doors, chambers, and decorations.

Key verses in this chapter include verse 4, which states, "Then he measured the room adjoining the sanctuary, twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide; and he said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.” This verse emphasizes the holiness of the temple's inner sanctuary and sets it apart from the rest of the temple.

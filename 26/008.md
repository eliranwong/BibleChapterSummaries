# Ezekiel 8

## Subheadings

* From verse 1 - Idolatrous Worship

## Summary

Ezekiel chapter 8 is a prophetic vision that the prophet Ezekiel received from God in the sixth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity (Ezekiel 8:1). In this chapter, Ezekiel is shown a vision of the idolatrous worship that was taking place inside the temple of God in Jerusalem. The vision reveals the extent of the spiritual corruption and disobedience of the people of Israel.

The chapter is structured into two main parts, with the first part (verses 1-6) describing the location of the idolatrous worship, and the second part (verses 7-18) revealing the nature of the idolatrous worship.

In the first part of the chapter, Ezekiel is taken in a vision to the entrance of the north gate of the temple, where he sees the image of jealousy that provokes God to anger (Ezekiel 8:3-5). The image is likely an idol or a statue of a foreign god that the Israelites were worshipping. Ezekiel then witnesses the elders of Israel engaging in idolatrous worship by offering incense and bowing down to the idols (Ezekiel 8:11-12).

The second part of the chapter provides a more detailed description of the various forms of idolatrous worship that were taking place in the temple. Ezekiel sees women weeping for the god Tammuz, a fertility deity (Ezekiel 8:14). He also sees men worshipping the sun in the temple courtyard (Ezekiel 8:16).

The key verse in this chapter is Ezekiel 8:6, which states, "Son of man, do you see what they are doingâ€”the utterly detestable things the Israelites are doing here, things that will drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see things that are even more detestable." This verse highlights the severity of the sin of idolatry and its consequences. It also foreshadows the even greater sins that Ezekiel will see in subsequent visions.

In terms of significant characters, events, and symbols, the main character is Ezekiel, who receives the vision from God. The significant event is the revelation of the idolatrous worship taking place in the temple. The symbols include the image of jealousy and the various idols and deities being worshipped.

The main themes or messages of the chapter are the sin of idolatry, the severity of God's judgment, and the need for repentance and obedience. The historical and cultural context is important to understand this chapter as it speaks to the spiritual condition of the Israelites during the Babylonian captivity.

Theologians, scholars, and religious leaders have interpreted this chapter as a warning against idolatry and a call to repentance. Some have also seen it as a reminder of the consequences of sin and disobedience.

One controversy related to this chapter is the exact identity of the image of jealousy and the various gods and deities being worshipped. Some scholars believe that the image of jealousy represents the Babylonian god Marduk, while others see it as a symbol of the Israelites' infidelity to God. Similarly, the identity of the various gods and deities is a subject of debate among scholars.

This chapter relates to other chapters and themes in the Bible, particularly the theme of judgment and the consequences of sin. It also foreshadows the coming destruction of Jerusalem, which is prophesied in subsequent chapters.

The lesson or morals that can be taken from this chapter are the dangers of idolatry and the importance of obedience to God's commands. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and the need for repentance and forgiveness.

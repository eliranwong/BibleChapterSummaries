From verse 1 - Ezekiel's Call and Mission

## Summary

Ezekiel 2 is a continuation of the book of Ezekiel, which is a prophetic book in the Old Testament. The chapter starts with God speaking to Ezekiel, who is referred to as "Son of man," and commanding him to stand on his feet so that He can speak to him. This phrase "Son of man" is used in the book of Ezekiel to refer to Ezekiel himself, but it also has Messianic implications as it is used in the New Testament to refer to Jesus.

Ezekiel's Call and Mission:
God then gives Ezekiel a message to deliver to the Israelites, who are a rebellious people. He warns Ezekiel that they will not listen to him because they have a stubborn and rebellious heart. However, God still wants Ezekiel to deliver the message, even if it is not received well.

The chapter is structured in a way that highlights the importance of Ezekiel's mission. God emphasizes the difficulty of the task, but also reassures Ezekiel that He will be with him to make it possible. The tone of the chapter is one of urgency and seriousness, as God is calling Ezekiel to deliver a message that will have significant consequences.

Key Verses:
There are several key verses in this chapter, including:

- "And he said to me, 'Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to nations of rebels, who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day.'" (Ezekiel 2:3)
- "And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions. Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house." (Ezekiel 2:6)
- "But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Be not rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you." (Ezekiel 2:8)

Significant Characters, Events, or Symbols:
The main character in this chapter is Ezekiel, who is called by God to be a prophet to the Israelites. The Israelites themselves are also a significant part of the chapter, as they are the ones who have rebelled against God and are in need of a message of warning and repentance.

The symbols in the chapter are mostly related to the difficulty of Ezekiel's mission. The briers, thorns, and scorpions mentioned in verse 6 represent the opposition that Ezekiel will face in delivering his message. The fact that God tells Ezekiel to eat the scroll in verse 8 is also symbolic, as it represents the importance of internalizing God's message and making it a part of oneself.

Main Themes or Messages:
The main theme of this chapter is the call of Ezekiel to be a prophet to the Israelites. God emphasizes the difficulty of the task and the rebelliousness of the people, but also reassures Ezekiel that He will be with him and give him the words to say.

Another theme is the importance of internalizing God's message and making it a part of oneself. This is seen through the symbolic act of eating the scroll, which represents the need for Ezekiel to fully understand and absorb the message he is delivering.

Historical or Cultural Context:
Ezekiel was a prophet who lived during the Babylonian exile, a period of time when many Israelites were taken captive and forced to live in Babylon. The Israelites were in a state of rebellion against God, and Ezekiel was called to deliver a message of warning and repentance to them.

The book of Ezekiel is also notable for its use of symbolism and imagery, which was common in ancient Near Eastern prophetic literature.

Interpretations and Controversies:
There is some debate among scholars about the exact nature of Ezekiel's message and how it should be interpreted. Some view it as a message of judgment and condemnation, while others see it as a call to repentance and restoration.

There is also some controversy surrounding the use of the phrase "Son of man" in the book of Ezekiel and its potential Messianic implications.

Relation to Other Chapters, Books, or Themes in the Bible:
The book of Ezekiel is part of a larger prophetic tradition in the Old Testament, which emphasizes the importance of obedience to God and the consequences of disobedience. The themes of judgment and restoration are also prominent in Ezekiel and other prophetic books.

The use of symbolism and imagery in Ezekiel is also related to other parts of the Bible, including the book of Revelation in the New Testament.

Lessons or Morals:
One lesson that can be taken from Ezekiel 2 is the importance of obedience to God, even in the face of difficulty and opposition. Ezekiel is called to deliver a message that he knows will be rejected, but he does so anyway because he trusts in God's guidance and direction.

Another lesson is the importance of internalizing God's message and making it a part of oneself. This is seen through the symbolic act of eating the scroll, which represents the need for us to fully understand and absorb God's message in our own lives.

## Summary

Ezekiel 10 is a continuation of the vision that Ezekiel had in chapter 1, where he saw a chariot throne carried by four living creatures, each with four faces and four wings. In this chapter, Ezekiel sees the glory of God depart from the temple in Jerusalem.

The chapter is structured into three main sections: the appearance of the glory of God (verses 1-5), the departure of the glory of God (verses 6-22), and the end of the vision (verse 23).

In the first section, Ezekiel sees a vision of God's glory above the cherubim. He describes the appearance of something like a sapphire stone, resembling the shape of a throne, visible above them. The cherubim are described as having four faces and four wings, and they are accompanied by coals of fire.

The key verses in this chapter are verses 4-5, which describe the movement of the cherubim and the sound of their wings. The sound is compared to the voice of the Almighty, and the movement is described as being like lightning.

The significant characters in this chapter are the cherubim and the glory of God. The cherubim are symbolic of God's power and presence, and the glory of God represents his holiness and majesty.

The main themes of this chapter are God's judgment and his sovereignty. The departure of the glory of God from the temple is a sign of judgment on the people of Israel for their disobedience and idolatry. However, it also demonstrates God's sovereignty over all creation, as he is able to appear and disappear as he pleases.

The historical context of this chapter is the Babylonian captivity of the Israelites. Ezekiel was one of the exiles who was taken to Babylon, and his prophecies were given during this time of national crisis.

Scholars and theologians have interpreted this chapter in a number of ways. Some see it as a literal vision of God's glory and judgment, while others see it as a symbolic representation of the spiritual condition of Israel. Some also see it as a precursor to the New Testament concept of the Holy Spirit dwelling within believers.

There are no major controversies related to this chapter, but some scholars have debated the meaning of the coals of fire and the sound of the cherubim's wings.

This chapter is related to other chapters and themes in the Bible, particularly the book of Revelation. The four living creatures in Ezekiel's vision are similar to the four living creatures in Revelation 4, and the throne of God is a recurring theme throughout the Bible.

The lesson that can be taken from this chapter is the importance of recognizing God's holiness and sovereignty. The departure of the glory of God from the temple was a sign of judgment, but it also demonstrated that God is in control and can appear and disappear as he pleases. As believers, we should recognize God's power and submit to his will.

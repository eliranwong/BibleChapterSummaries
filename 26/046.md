From verse 1 - Administration of the Temple

## Summary

Ezekiel 46 is a continuation of the vision of the new temple that Ezekiel received from God. This chapter focuses on the administration of the temple and the regulations that were to be followed in order to maintain its holiness.

The chapter begins with God instructing Ezekiel that the gate of the inner court that faces east shall be shut for six working days, but on the Sabbath day and the day of the new moon, it shall be opened. This emphasizes the importance of the Sabbath and the new moon as holy days in the temple.

The chapter then goes on to describe the offerings that were to be made on the Sabbath and the new moon. On the Sabbath day, a burnt offering of six lambs, a ram, and a grain offering was to be made. On the day of the new moon, a young bull, six lambs, and a ram were to be offered, along with a grain offering and a sin offering. These offerings were meant to be a symbol of the people's devotion and commitment to God.

The chapter also provides instructions for the prince's offerings. The prince was to provide a burnt offering, a grain offering, and a drink offering on the Sabbath day, as well as on the day of the new moon. This highlights the importance of the role of the prince in maintaining the holiness of the temple.

Furthermore, the chapter details the regulations for the feasts and festivals in the temple. During the feasts, the prince was to provide a burnt offering, a grain offering, and a drink offering. The people were also to bring their own offerings and present them to the prince.

In terms of the structure of the chapter, it is organized around the different offerings and regulations for the temple. Each section provides specific instructions for how to maintain the holiness of the temple and the importance of following these regulations.

One of the key verses in the chapter is verse 18 which states, "The prince shall not take any of the inheritance of the people, thrusting them out of their property. He shall give his sons their inheritance out of his own property, so that none of my people shall be scattered from his property." This verse emphasizes the importance of justice and fairness in the administration of the temple and the role of the prince in ensuring that the people's property rights were respected.

There are no significant characters or events in this chapter, but the symbols of the offerings and the regulations highlight the importance of maintaining the holiness of the temple and the people's devotion to God.

The main themes of this chapter include the importance of Sabbath and new moon days, the role of the prince in maintaining the holiness of the temple, and the regulations for offerings and festivals. These themes highlight the importance of following God's commands and maintaining the holiness of the temple.

In terms of historical and cultural context, this chapter was written during the Babylonian exile, when the people of Israel were separated from their homeland and their temple. The vision of the new temple and the regulations for its administration provided hope and a sense of continuity for the people during a difficult time.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter as emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's commands and maintaining the holiness of the temple. Some have also noted the significance of the role of the prince in ensuring justice and fairness.

There are no major controversies related to this chapter, but some interpretations may differ on the specifics of the offerings and regulations.

This chapter relates to other chapters and themes in the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament. It highlights the importance of the temple as a symbol of God's presence among his people and the need to maintain its holiness.

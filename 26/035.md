## Subheadings

* From verse 1 - Against Edom Again

## Summary

Ezekiel 35 is a chapter in the book of Ezekiel, which is one of the major prophetic books in the Old Testament. In this chapter, the prophet Ezekiel receives a message from the Lord concerning the nation of Edom.

1. Overview of the chapter:
The chapter begins with the word of the Lord coming to Ezekiel, instructing him to prophesy against Edom. This is not the first time that the Lord has addressed Edom through Ezekiel, as they had previously been warned about their hostility towards Israel. In this chapter, however, the Lord's judgment against Edom is more severe, as they have rejoiced over the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of the Israelites.

2. Structure and organization:
The chapter is structured around a series of declarations against Edom, interspersed with descriptions of their actions and the Lord's response. The first declaration is made in verses 2-4, where the Lord declares that he will turn Edom into a desolate wasteland. This is followed by a description of Edom's actions in verses 5-9, where they have demonstrated their hatred towards Israel and reveled in their downfall. The second declaration is made in verses 10-13, where the Lord promises to execute vengeance upon Edom for their actions. The chapter concludes with a declaration of the Lord's sovereignty over all nations, both Israel and their enemies.

3. Key verses:
- "I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities shall not be inhabited." (v. 9)
- "Thus says the Lord God: Because you said, ‘These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will take possession of them,’ although the Lord was there," (v. 10)
- "Thus I will make Mount Seir a desolation and a waste, and I will cut off from it all who come and go." (v. 15)

4. Significant characters, events, and symbols:
The main character in this chapter is Edom, which represents the enemies of Israel who have rejoiced over their downfall. The events described in this chapter concern the Lord's judgment against Edom for their hostility towards Israel. The symbol of the desolate wasteland represents the punishment that Edom will receive for their actions.

5. Main themes and messages:
The main theme of this chapter is the Lord's justice and sovereignty over all nations. The Lord will not tolerate the rejoicing of his enemies over the downfall of his people, and he will execute judgment against them. The chapter also highlights the importance of repentance and turning away from sin, as Edom had the opportunity to repent but chose to persist in their wickedness.

6. Historical and cultural context:
Edom was a neighboring nation to Israel, located to the south-east of Judah. They were descendants of Esau, the twin brother of Jacob (who was later renamed Israel), and had a long history of conflict with Israel. The destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of the Israelites had occurred prior to this chapter, and Edom had taken advantage of the situation to attack Israel and gloat over their downfall.

7. Interpretations by theologians and religious leaders:
Many theologians and religious leaders interpret this chapter as a warning against rejoicing over the downfall of others and the importance of repentance. It is also seen as a reminder of the Lord's justice and sovereignty over all nations, and the consequences of persisting in sin.

8. Popular interpretations and controversies:
One controversial aspect of this chapter is the use of violent language and imagery to describe the Lord's judgment against Edom. Some interpret this as evidence of the violent nature of the Old Testament God, while others argue that it is a reflection of the severity of Edom's sin and the consequences of rejecting God.

9. Relation to other chapters, books, and themes in the Bible:
This chapter is part of a larger section in the book of Ezekiel that deals with the judgment of Israel's enemies, including Edom, Tyre, and Egypt. It also relates to the theme of God's justice and sovereignty that runs throughout the Old Testament and is further developed in the New Testament.

10. Lessons and morals:
The chapter teaches us the importance of treating others with compassion and not rejoicing over their downfall. It also reminds us of the consequences of persisting in sin and rejecting God's call to repentance. Finally, it highlights the Lord's sovereignty over all nations and the importance of trusting in him even in times of hardship and persecution.

From verse 1 - Allegory of the Shepherds

## Summary

Ezekiel chapter 20 is a lengthy chapter that provides an allegory of the shepherds of Israel. The chapter begins with a historical context where the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord and sat before Ezekiel. The prophet then receives a message from the Lord to speak to the elders of Israel.

The chapter is structured around the allegory of the shepherds, which is divided into three parts. The first part, from verse 1 to 29, recounts the history of Israel from the time they were in Egypt to their present situation in Babylon. The Lord reminds the elders of Israel of the numerous times they rebelled against Him and turned to other gods, despite His continued mercy and grace towards them. The Lord also reminds them of the consequences of their disobedience, including their exile in Babylon.

The second part of the allegory, from verse 30 to 44, focuses on the present day situation of the elders of Israel. The Lord accuses them of being like their ancestors who rebelled against Him and turned to other gods. He rebukes them for seeking His guidance while still holding on to their idols and sinful ways.

The third and final part of the allegory, from verse 45 to 49, is a prophecy about the future. The Lord promises to gather the Israelites from the nations where they have been scattered and to purify them. He also promises to establish a new covenant with them and to dwell among them forever.

One of the key verses in the chapter is verse 12, where the Lord says, "Moreover, I gave them my Sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctifies them." This verse highlights the importance of the Sabbath as a sign of the covenant between God and His people.

The main theme of the chapter is the faithfulness of God towards His people, despite their constant rebellion and disobedience. The Lord reminds the elders of Israel of His continued mercy and grace towards them throughout their history. He also highlights the consequences of their disobedience and the need for repentance and turning back to Him.

To fully understand the chapter, it is important to consider the historical and cultural context of Israel during that time. The Israelites were in exile in Babylon, and their faith was being challenged by the idolatrous practices of their captors. The Lord used Ezekiel to remind them of their covenant with Him and to call them back to obedience.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter as a warning against idolatry and disobedience to God. They also see it as a reminder of the importance of the Sabbath as a sign of the covenant between God and His people. Some scholars have also noted the similarities between this chapter and other prophetic books such as Jeremiah and Isaiah.

There are no significant controversies related to this chapter, but some interpret it as a call to repentance and a reminder of God's faithfulness towards His people. Others see it as a warning against disobedience and idolatry.

Ezekiel chapter 20 relates to other chapters in the Bible that deal with the history of Israel and their relationship with God. It also relates to themes such as repentance, obedience, and God's faithfulness.

The lessons and morals that can be taken from this chapter include the importance of obeying God, the consequences of disobedience, and the need for repentance and turning back to Him. It also highlights the significance of the Sabbath as a sign of the covenant between God and His people.

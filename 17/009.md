## Summary

Esther chapter 9 recounts the day of vengeance that the Jews had over their enemies and the establishment of Purim as a celebration of their salvation. The chapter is organized into two sections: the first section describing the events of the day of vengeance, and the second section describing the establishment of Purim.

The first section of the chapter begins with the Jews' victory over their enemies on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which was the day that the king's decree was to be executed. The Jews had feared for their lives due to the decree that allowed their enemies to attack them, but the situation was reversed, and the Jews were able to defend themselves and defeat their enemies. The Jews killed 75,000 of their enemies but did not take any of their plunder.

The second section of the chapter describes the establishment of Purim. The Jews celebrated their victory by resting on the fourteenth day of the month and feasting on the fifteenth day. Mordecai, a prominent Jew in the Persian court, wrote a letter to all the Jews throughout the kingdom, instructing them to celebrate these two days every year as the feast of Purim. The letter detailed the events that had taken place and the reason for the celebration, and it was sent with the authority of Queen Esther.

The main theme of Esther 9 is the providence of God in the lives of his people. Despite the king's decree and the Jews' fear of their enemies, God intervened and gave them victory over their enemies. The chapter also emphasizes the importance of celebrating and remembering God's salvation. The establishment of Purim serves as a reminder of the Jews' deliverance from their enemies and their continued reliance on God.

The historical context of Esther 9 is important in understanding the chapter. The Persian Empire was a dominant world power at the time, and the Jews were a minority group within the empire. The decree to attack the Jews was a result of Haman's hatred towards them, and his desire for power and influence in the Persian court. The Jews' victory over their enemies is a testament to God's faithfulness and protection of his people in the face of adversity.

Theologians and religious leaders interpret Esther 9 as a reminder of God's sovereignty and his faithfulness to his people. The chapter also emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's commands, as seen in Mordecai's letter to the Jews instructing them to celebrate Purim. The establishment of Purim is significant because it shows the importance of remembering and celebrating God's faithfulness and deliverance.

One controversy surrounding Esther 9 is the portrayal of violence and the killing of 75,000 people. Some argue that this goes against the teachings of love and non-violence in the Bible, while others see it as a necessary act of self-defense in the face of persecution.

Esther 9 is connected to the larger themes of God's protection and deliverance throughout the Bible. The story of Esther and the Jews' victory over their enemies is a reminder of the ways in which God intervenes in the lives of his people. The establishment of Purim as a celebration of deliverance is similar to the celebration of Passover in the Old Testament, which commemorated God's deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt.

The lesson that can be taken from Esther 9 is the importance of trusting in God's providence and celebrating his deliverance. In times of adversity and persecution, we can look to the example of the Jews in Esther's time and remember that God is faithful to his people. The establishment of Purim as a celebration reminds us to be grateful for God's protection and deliverance in our own lives.

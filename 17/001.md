- Verse 19: "Therefore, if it pleases the king, let a royal decree go out from him, and let it be recorded in the laws of Persia and Media, so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti shall never again come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she."

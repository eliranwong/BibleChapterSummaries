## Summary

Esther 5 is a pivotal chapter in the book of Esther as it sets the stage for Esther's plan to save her people. This chapter highlights Esther's bravery and strategic thinking as she approaches King Xerxes to plead for her people's lives. 

Esther's Preparation and Audience with the King:
The chapter starts with Esther preparing herself to approach the king. She puts on royal attire and stands in the inner court of the king's palace, facing the king's palace. She must have been nervous as approaching the king without an invitation was punishable by death. However, Esther was determined to save her people. When the king saw her, he welcomed her and offered to grant her request, even up to half of his kingdom. Esther, however, asks for a banquet with the king and Haman, which the king readily agrees to.

The First Banquet:
At the banquet, the king again asks Esther what she desires, promising to grant it. However, Esther again delays and asks the king to come to another banquet the following day. At this point, the reader can feel the suspense building as Esther has yet to reveal her request to the king.

Haman's Boasting and Anger:
On his way home from the banquet, Haman sees Mordecai, Esther's cousin, who refuses to bow down to him. This infuriates Haman, who decides to build a gallows to hang Mordecai. Haman is so arrogant and full of himself that he boasts to his family and friends about his wealth and power and how he has been invited to a banquet by the queen. 

The key verse in this chapter is Esther's request for a banquet with the king and Haman. This request was strategic as it gave Esther time to gather her thoughts and come up with a plan to save her people.

King Xerxes is the ruler of the Persian Empire and the one who has the power to grant Esther's request. Haman is the villain of the story who is willing to kill an entire race of people out of hatred and arrogance.

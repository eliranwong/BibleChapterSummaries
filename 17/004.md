## Summary

Esther 4 is a chapter that highlights the bravery and faith of Esther and Mordecai, and how their actions ultimately saved the Jewish people from destruction. The chapter begins with Mordecai mourning and weeping loudly in response to the edict from King Ahasuerus, which ordered the destruction of all Jews in the Persian Empire. He tears his clothes, puts on sackcloth and ashes, and cries out in despair, which is a sign of mourning and repentance in Jewish culture.

Mordecai's Mourning:
Mordecai's mourning is not just for himself, but for the entire Jewish community. He is distressed by the prospect of their annihilation and calls on Esther, his cousin and queen, to help. Esther is initially unaware of the edict, as she is secluded in the palace and has not been told of the events happening outside. When she sends her servant to inquire about Mordecai's behavior, she learns of the edict and is understandably upset.

Esther Informed of the Edict:
Mordecai sends a message to Esther, urging her to go before the king and plead for her people. However, Esther is hesitant because it is against the law to approach the king without being summoned. Mordecai reminds her that she is also a Jew and will be affected by the edict, and encourages her to take action. He tells her that perhaps she was made queen "for such a time as this" (Esther 4:14), suggesting that it is her duty to help her people in this dire situation.

Esther's Decision to Act:
Esther decides to take action and tells Mordecai to gather all the Jews in Susa to fast and pray for her. She also fasts for three days, which is a sign of repentance and humility. On the third day, she dresses in her royal robes and goes before the king, risking her life to plead for her people. The king is pleased to see her but asks her why she has come without being summoned. Esther cleverly invites the king and Haman, the man responsible for the edict, to a banquet the next day, where she will reveal her request.

The main themes of Esther 4 include faith, courage, and the power of prayer. Mordecai's mourning and Esther's decision to act show that faith and courage can inspire people to take action and make a difference. The power of prayer is also highlighted, as Esther and the Jews fast and pray for guidance and strength.

The historical and cultural context of Esther 4 is important to understand the significance of the events. The Persian Empire was a vast and powerful empire that ruled over many different cultures and religions. The Jews were a minority group within this empire, and the edict to destroy them was a significant threat to their existence. The fact that Esther was a Jew who had risen to a position of power and influence within the empire was rare and significant, and her bravery in risking her life to save her people was a testament to her faith and courage.

Theologians and religious leaders have interpreted Esther 4 as an example of the power of faith and courage in the face of adversity. The story also emphasizes the importance of taking action to help others, even when it is risky or uncomfortable.

There are controversies regarding the book of Esther as a whole, as it does not mention God explicitly and some scholars question its historical accuracy. However, the story of Esther and Mordecai's bravery and faith has been celebrated in Jewish and Christian traditions for centuries.

Esther 4 relates to other chapters and themes in the Bible, such as the importance of following God's will and standing up for what is right, even in the face of persecution. The story also highlights the idea of divine providence, as Esther's rise to power and her bravery in saving her people can be seen as part of God's plan.

The lessons and morals that can be taken from Esther 4 include the importance of faith, courage, and taking action to help others in need. The chapter also emphasizes the power of prayer and the idea that even seemingly small actions can have a significant impact.

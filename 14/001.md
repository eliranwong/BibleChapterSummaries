2 Chronicles 1 is a chapter that focuses on the reign of King Solomon, the son of David and Bathsheba, and his early years as ruler of Israel. The chapter begins by highlighting how Solomon's kingdom was strengthened, and how the Lord his God was with him and magnified him exceedingly.

Solomon Offers Sacrifices at Gibeon:
The chapter goes on to describe how Solomon went to Gibeon, which was the most important high place, to offer sacrifices to the Lord. This was a common practice during the time, as it was believed that the Lord would answer prayers made at high places. During this time, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream and offered him anything he wanted. Solomon asked for wisdom and knowledge to govern his people, which pleased the Lord greatly.

Solomon's Prayer for Wisdom:
Solomon's prayer for wisdom is a key passage in this chapter, as it not only shows his humility and desire to serve his people well, but it also reveals the heart of God towards those who seek Him. In verse 10, Solomon acknowledges that he is young and inexperienced, and that he does not know how to go out or come in. He asks God to give him an understanding heart to discern between good and evil, so that he can judge God's people rightly. This prayer pleased the Lord, and He granted Solomon's request, giving him not only wisdom and knowledge, but also wealth, riches and honor.

Solomon's Prosperity:
The rest of the chapter focuses on Solomon's prosperity and how he became one of the richest and most powerful kings in the world. Verse 14 states that he gathered chariots, horses, and gold and silver in abundance, and that his wealth surpassed that of any other king in the world. The chapter ends by describing how Solomon made silver and gold as common as stones in Jerusalem, and how he had great success in everything he did.

The main themes of this chapter are the importance of seeking wisdom from God, the blessings that come from obeying God, and the greatness of Solomon's reign. The chapter also highlights the significance of high places in Israel's worship, and how God responded to Solomon's prayer for wisdom.

Ahaz
The chapter begins by introducing King Ahaz, who was only twenty years old when he became king and reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem.

Ahaz’s Unfaithfulness
The verses that follow describe the unfaithfulness of Ahaz. He worshiped idols, made sacrifices to foreign gods, and even sacrificed his own children in the fire. As a result of his disobedience, the Lord allowed the king of Aram to defeat Judah and take many of its people captive.

Ahaz’s Alliance with Assyria
In an attempt to regain power, Ahaz made an alliance with the king of Assyria. However, this alliance did not bring him the success he hoped for. Instead, the Assyrian king attacked him and caused even more devastation in Judah.

Ahaz’s Punishment
Despite all of this, Ahaz did not repent or turn to the Lord. Instead, he continued to worship idols and ignore God’s commands. As a result, the Lord punished him severely. The chapter ends with Ahaz’s death and burial in Jerusalem, but his legacy of unfaithfulness continued to plague Judah.

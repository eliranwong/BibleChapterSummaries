The chapter begins with the introduction of Abijah as the new king of Judah and his ascension to the throne. It then describes the confrontation between Abijah and Jeroboam, which led to a battle between their armies.

Key verses in this chapter include verse 12, where Abijah declares to Jeroboam that Judah has remained faithful to the Lord while Israel has turned away from Him. Another important verse is verse 18, which states that "Thus the children of Israel were subdued at that time; and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the Lord God of their fathers."

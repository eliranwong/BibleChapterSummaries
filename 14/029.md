Significant characters/events/symbols:
Hezekiah is the main character in this chapter, and his reforms are the central focus. The Temple and its furnishings are also significant symbols in this chapter, as they are cleansed and restored to their proper use.

Themes/messages:
The main theme of the chapter is the importance of worshiping God in the proper way, with a pure heart and a clean Temple. Hezekiah's reforms emphasize the need to repent of past sins and turn back to God, and his dedication to this task inspires the people of Judah to follow his lead.

Historical/cultural context:
The reign of Hezekiah took place in the late 8th century BCE, during a time of political upheaval and religious syncretism in the Near East. The Assyrian Empire was expanding its territory and threatening the stability of smaller kingdoms like Judah, and many people in Judah were turning to worship other gods alongside Yahweh.

Interpretations:
The chapter is often seen as a model for religious reform and renewal, both in its emphasis on the need for repentance and its celebration of Passover as a symbol of God's deliverance. Some scholars also see Hezekiah's reforms as a response to the Assyrian threat, with the king seeking to unify his people and strengthen their faith in Yahweh.

Controversies:
Some scholars have debated the historical accuracy of the chapter, particularly the details of Hezekiah's reforms and the extent of his influence on the people of Judah. Others have questioned the theological implications of the chapter, particularly the idea that God's anger can be appeased through ritual sacrifice and obedience to the Law.

Relationship to other chapters/books/themes:
2 Chronicles is part of the Deuteronomistic History, a series of books that tell the story of Israel from the conquest of Canaan to the Babylonian exile. The themes of covenant, repentance, and worship are central to this history, and are echoed throughout the rest of the Bible.

Lessons/morals:
The chapter teaches us the importance of worshiping God in the proper way, with a pure heart and a clean Temple. It also emphasizes the need for repentance and turning back to God when we have strayed from his path. Finally, the chapter reminds us of the power of collective worship and celebration, as seen in the Passover feast.

## Summary

2 Chronicles 19 is a chapter in the Old Testament that focuses on the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. The chapter begins with Jehoshaphat returning safely to Jerusalem after a successful battle against the Moabites and Ammonites. Then, the prophet Jehu rebukes Jehoshaphat for forming an alliance with Ahab, the wicked king of Israel, and for helping him in battle. Jehu reminds Jehoshaphat that God is displeased with Ahab and his family and warns him to avoid them in the future.

The chapter is structured in a narrative form, with Jehoshaphat's return and the rebuke from Jehu serving as the key events. The chapter also includes a speech from Jehoshaphat to the judges of Judah, in which he charges them to judge fairly and to fear God. 

There are several key verses in this chapter, including:

- "Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord? Because of this, wrath has gone out against you from the Lord" (verse 2)
- "Consider what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for the Lord who is with you in the judgment" (verse 6)
- "Take heed to what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment" (verse 10)

The main character in this chapter is King Jehoshaphat, who receives rebuke from the prophet Jehu. The key event is when Jehoshaphat charges the judges of Judah to judge fairly and to fear God. 

The main themes of this chapter include the importance of avoiding alliances with wicked people, the need for fair judgment, and the fear of God. The passage also emphasizes that God is displeased with those who help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord. 

To understand this chapter, it is important to consider the historical and cultural context of the time. The chapter takes place during a period of political instability and conflict between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. King Ahab of Israel was notorious for his wickedness and disobedience to God, which is why Jehu rebukes Jehoshaphat for forming an alliance with him.

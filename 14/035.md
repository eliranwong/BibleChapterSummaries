## Summary

2 Chronicles 35 is a chapter that details the celebration of the Passover by King Josiah in Jerusalem. The chapter is divided into two main sections: the Passover celebration and Josiah's death.

Passover Celebration:
The chapter begins with the statement that King Josiah kept the Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem. The Passover was a significant Jewish festival that commemorated the Israelites' liberation from slavery in Egypt. The celebration required the sacrifice of a lamb or goat, which was then eaten with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

In this chapter, we see that Josiah took great care to ensure that the Passover was celebrated according to the law of Moses. He instructed the Levites to prepare themselves and the temple for the celebration, and to oversee the offering of the sacrifices. He also provided many animals for the sacrifices and gave gifts to the priests and Levites.

The verses in this chapter are structured in a chronological order, detailing the preparations for the Passover, the celebration itself, and the aftermath. The chapter emphasizes the importance of following the law of Moses and the need for repentance and obedience to God.

Key Verses:
One of the key verses in this chapter is verse 18: "There had been no Passover like it in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. None of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated such a Passover as did Josiah, with the priests, the Levites and all Judah and Israel who were there with the people of Jerusalem."

Significant Characters, Events, and Symbols:

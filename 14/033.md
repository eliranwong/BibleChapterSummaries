Manasseh's Reign and Restoration:
The chapter begins by introducing Manasseh, who became king at the age of 12. Manasseh is described as a wicked king who did evil in the sight of God. He practiced idol worship and built altars to false gods in the temple of the Lord. He even sacrificed his own children to these gods.

As a result of his wickedness, God allowed the Assyrian army to capture Manasseh and take him captive to Babylon. In Babylon, Manasseh repented of his sins and begged God for forgiveness. God heard his prayer and restored him to his throne in Jerusalem.

After his restoration, Manasseh removed the idols and altars of false gods that he had built and restored the altar of the Lord. He also commanded the people of Judah to worship the Lord and follow his commandments.

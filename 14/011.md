# 2 Chronicles 11

## Subheadings

* From verse 1 - Idolatry in Judah

## Summary

2 Chronicles 11 is a continuation of the narrative of the reign of King Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, after the kingdom of Israel was divided into two. This chapter focuses on the establishment of the kingdom of Judah, which includes the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. 

The chapter begins with Rehoboam gathering an army of 180,000 warriors from Judah and Benjamin to fight against Israel and restore the kingdom to him. However, God sends a prophet named Shemaiah to warn Rehoboam not to go to war against his brothers, resulting in the army being disbanded.

The chapter then shifts its focus to the issue of idolatry in Judah. Rehoboam and his people abandoned the worship of the Lord and turned to worship other gods, particularly the golden calves which were set up in Dan and Bethel by Jeroboam, the king of Israel. This led to the Lord's anger being kindled against Judah.

Verses 4-12 describe the fortifications that Rehoboam built to protect his kingdom against potential enemies. He strengthened the cities of Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. He also appointed army commanders and stationed troops throughout the land.

The chapter ends with a list of Rehoboam's sons and daughters, as well as his wise counselors and officials.

Overall, 2 Chronicles 11 emphasizes the importance of obedience to God and the dangers of idolatry. It also highlights the need for strong leadership and military defense in times of instability and conflict. The historical context of this chapter is the division of the kingdom of Israel and the struggle for power between the two kingdoms. 

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter as a cautionary tale against turning away from God and the consequences that follow. The fortifications built by Rehoboam are seen as a symbol of human effort to protect oneself, while the warning of the prophet Shemaiah reminds us to trust in God's protection. 

There are no major controversies or popular interpretations related to this chapter. However, it is important to note that the themes of idolatry and obedience to God are recurring themes throughout the Old Testament and continue to be relevant to contemporary religious discourse. 

2 Chronicles 11 is connected to other chapters in the Bible, particularly 1 Kings 12, which describes the division of the kingdom of Israel. It also connects to the theme of the importance of obedience to God, which is a major theme throughout the Old Testament. 

The main lesson from this chapter is the importance of remaining faithful to God and the dangers of turning away from him. It also emphasizes the need for strong leadership and military defense in times of instability and conflict.

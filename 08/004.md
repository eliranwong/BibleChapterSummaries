## Summary

Ruth chapter 4 tells the story of Boaz and Ruth and how they came to be married. The chapter begins with Boaz going to the gate of the city and meeting the near kinsman, whom he had previously mentioned to Ruth as having the right of redemption. Boaz calls him over and presents the situation to him, offering him the opportunity to redeem Ruth's family's land. The near kinsman agrees to redeem the land but is informed by Boaz that in doing so, he would also have to marry Ruth and raise up offspring in her deceased husband's name. The near kinsman then relinquishes his rights to Boaz.

Boaz then affirms his willingness to redeem Ruth and the land, and the witnesses and elders bless him and Ruth as they become husband and wife. The chapter concludes with the birth of their son, Obed, who would become the grandfather of King David.

The chapter is structured around the actions and decisions of Boaz, the near kinsman, and the witnesses and elders. Boaz takes the initiative to approach the near kinsman and offer him the opportunity to redeem the land. He then affirms his own willingness to redeem Ruth and the land and receives the blessing of the witnesses and elders as a result. The near kinsman, on the other hand, initially agrees to redeem the land but ultimately relinquishes his rights to Boaz. The witnesses and elders play a supporting role, offering their blessing and encouragement to Boaz and Ruth.

The key verses in this chapter are verses 9 and 10, where Boaz presents the situation to the near kinsman and the near kinsman relinquishes his rights to Boaz.

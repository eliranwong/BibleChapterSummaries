## Summary

Ruth 3 is a pivotal chapter in the book of Ruth, which tells the story of a Moabite woman who chooses to follow her mother-in-law Naomi back to Bethlehem after her husband's death. This chapter centers on the events that lead to Ruth's marriage to Boaz, which becomes a crucial part of the genealogy of Jesus Christ.

Naomi's Counsel to Ruth (verses 1-5):
The chapter begins with Naomi, Ruth's mother-in-law, suggesting that Ruth should seek rest and security by approaching Boaz, a wealthy relative of Naomi's late husband. Naomi instructs Ruth to prepare herself and go to the threshing floor where Boaz will be working, and to wait until he lies down to sleep. Then, she should uncover his feet and lie down at his feet, which was a customary way of indicating a desire for marriage.

Ruth's Obedience and Proposing to Boaz (verses 6-9):
Ruth follows Naomi's instructions and goes to the threshing floor, where she finds Boaz sleeping. She uncovers his feet and lies down, and Boaz wakes up to find her there. Ruth makes her proposal to Boaz, asking him to spread his cloak over her, which was a symbolic way of asking him to marry her. This act shows Ruth's faith in God's provision, as well as her courage and initiative in seeking a solution to her and Naomi's difficult circumstances.

Boaz's Response and Praise (verses 10-13):
Boaz is impressed by Ruth's loyalty and kindness, and he responds favorably to her proposal. He praises her for her character and acknowledges her as a woman of noble character. He also promises to take care of her and provide for her needs, even though there is another relative who has a closer claim to marry her.

Boaz's Provision and Ruth's Departure (verses 14-15):
Boaz gives Ruth six measures of barley as a sign of his commitment to her, and instructs her to take it back to Naomi. He also sends her away before daylight to avoid any scandal or gossip that might arise from their meeting. Ruth returns to Naomi with the barley and tells her everything that has happened.

Ruth's Report to Naomi (verse 16):
Naomi is pleased with the outcome of Ruth's encounter with Boaz, and she recognizes that Boaz is a close relative who has the right to redeem their family's land and provide for their security. This sets the stage for the events of the next chapter, where Boaz will make a formal proposal for marriage and redeem their family's land.

The main themes of this chapter include loyalty, courage, faith, and provision. Ruth's actions show her loyalty to Naomi and her faith in God's provision, as well as her courage in taking the initiative to propose to Boaz. Boaz's response demonstrates his character and his commitment to providing for Ruth and Naomi's needs.

To understand this chapter fully, it is important to recognize the historical and cultural context of the time. The custom of lying at someone's feet was a way of seeking protection or claiming a right to marriage. Boaz's provision of barley was a sign of his commitment to Ruth and his willingness to provide for her needs. The story also reflects the importance of family and community ties in ancient Israel, and the role of women in securing their family's future.

Theologians and scholars have interpreted this chapter in various ways, but it is generally seen as a story of redemption, both in the sense of Boaz's provision for Ruth and Naomi, and in the broader sense of God's plan for salvation through Jesus Christ, who is descended from the line of Boaz and Ruth.

One controversy related to this chapter is the question of Ruth's actions at the threshing floor, which some have interpreted as inappropriate or even immoral. However, most scholars see Ruth's actions as a legitimate way of seeking marriage and protection, which reflects the cultural norms of the time.

This chapter is closely connected to other books and themes in the Bible, particularly the theme of redemption and the genealogy of Jesus Christ. The story of Ruth and Boaz also reflects the importance of faith and trust in God's provision, and the power of loyalty and kindness in building relationships and communities.

The lessons and morals of this chapter include the importance of loyalty, faith, courage, and initiative in seeking God's provision and fulfilling our responsibilities to others. It also highlights the importance of community and family ties in securing our future and contributing to God's plan of redemption.

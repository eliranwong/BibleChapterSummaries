In the second section, the author reminds readers to remember God in their youth and throughout their lives. Verses 7-8 encourage readers to enjoy their youth while being mindful of God's presence and authority. The author reminds readers that life is fleeting and unpredictable, and that youth is a time to be joyful and carefree while still remembering God.

Verses 9-10 emphasize the importance of remembering God throughout one's life. The author advises readers to live in the present moment while also being mindful of God's judgment. The author reminds readers that everything they do will ultimately be judged by God, and encourages them to live a life that is pleasing to Him.

Overall, the main themes of Ecclesiastes 11 are generosity, enjoying life, and remembering God.

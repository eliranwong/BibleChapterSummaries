Ecclesiastes 7 is a chapter in the book of Ecclesiastes that contains proverbs on wisdom, reflections on the paradox of wickedness and righteousness, the folly of extremes, and a discussion of women, wisdom, and folly.

The chapter is structured into four sections, each with its own theme and message. The first section, from verse 1 to 14, discusses the importance of wisdom and the value of a good name. The author emphasizes that a good reputation is more valuable than material possessions, and that death is preferable to birth because it marks the end of one's struggles and the beginning of eternal life. The author also encourages people to embrace sorrow and to learn from it, rather than seeking constant pleasure.

The second section, from verse 15 to 18, presents a paradoxical view of wickedness and righteousness. The author acknowledges the existence of both good and evil in the world and recognizes that even the most righteous people are not perfect.

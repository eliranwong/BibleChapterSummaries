Ecclesiastes 4 is a chapter that touches on several themes that are central to the human experience. In this chapter, the author observes oppression, envy, achievement, selfish toil, and political power. The chapter is organized into four subheadings, each of which addresses a particular aspect of the human condition.

Oppression and Injustice (verses 1-3)
The chapter opens with a description of the oppression and injustice that the author has observed. The author notes that the powerful have the upper hand and that the oppressed have no comforter. The author sees the tears of the oppressed and is deeply troubled by their suffering. The author's observation of oppression and injustice highlights the fact that the world is not fair, and that the powerful often exploit the weak.

Envy and Achievement (verses 4-6)
The second subheading of the chapter addresses the issue of envy and achievement. The author notes that people are driven by envy, and that they work hard to achieve success. However, the author also observes that this pursuit of success is ultimately meaningless, as the successful person will eventually die and leave their achievements behind. The author concludes that envy and achievement are ultimately futile pursuits.

The Folly of Selfish Toil (verses 7-12)
The third subheading of the chapter addresses the folly of selfish toil. The author notes that people work hard to accumulate wealth and possessions, but that this pursuit is ultimately meaningless. The author argues that it is better to have companionship and to share in the joys and sorrows of life, rather than to toil selfishly for personal gain. The author concludes that the pursuit of wealth and possessions is ultimately meaningless, and that true happiness comes from companionship and shared experience.

The Futility of Political Power (verses 13-16)
The final subheading of the chapter addresses the futility of political power. The author notes that political power is fleeting and that those who hold it will eventually be replaced by others. The author argues that it is better to be content with a modest life than to strive for political power, which is ultimately meaningless.

Overall, Ecclesiastes 4 is a chapter that speaks to the human condition. The author observes the injustices of the world, the futility of envy and achievement, the folly of selfish toil, and the fleeting nature of political power. The chapter emphasizes the importance of companionship and shared experience over personal gain and individual achievement.

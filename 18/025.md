## Summary

Job 25 is a short chapter in the book of Job that continues the conversation between Job and his friends. Bildad the Shuhite speaks in this chapter, and his speech focuses on two main themes: God's majesty and human worthlessness.

Bildad begins his speech by acknowledging God's power and majesty. He asks, "Dominion and awe belong to God; he establishes order in the heights of heaven" (Job 25:2). Bildad emphasizes God's sovereignty and control over all things, including the heavens and the earth. He also points out that God's power is beyond human understanding, stating, "Can his forces be numbered? On whom does his light not rise?" (Job 25:3).

Bildad then turns his attention to human beings and their worthlessness in comparison to God. He asks, "How then can a mortal be righteous before God? How can one born of woman be pure?" (Job 25:4). Bildad is suggesting that humans are inherently sinful and impure, and therefore cannot be righteous before God. He also implies that humans are insignificant in comparison to God, stating, "Even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not pure in his eyes" (Job 25:5).
